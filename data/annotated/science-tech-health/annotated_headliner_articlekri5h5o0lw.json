  "context": [
    "Published in Nature Machine Intelligence, an Australian team led by Monash University researchers has developed a generative AI tool that mimics scientists to support and speed up the process of scientific discoveries.",
    "Named LLM4SD (Large Language Model 4 Scientific Discovery), the new AI system is an interactive Large Language Model (LLM) tool which can carry out basic steps of scientific research i.e. retrieve useful information from literature and develop hypotheses from data analysis. The tool is freely available and open source."
