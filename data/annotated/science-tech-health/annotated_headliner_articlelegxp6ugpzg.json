  "context": [
    "It’s hard to imagine a drone doing what a flying squirrel does best: gliding, braking midair, and darting through forests with acrobatic grace. Yet that’s precisely the inspiration behind a new breed of aerial robot, equipped with flexible, foldable wings and a ‘brain’ powered by machine learning.",
    "Engineers in South Korea have developed a drone that mimics this airborne behavior — a quadrotor equipped with foldable wing membranes that can suddenly slow down, execute sharp turns, and avoid obstacles in ways that traditional drones cannot."

      "paragraph": "Flying squirrels don’t actually fly — they glide. They stretch flaps of skin between their wrists and ankles, creating a kind of natural wingsuit. It’s an evolutionary design that allows them to steer through complex terrain and, crucially, to decelerate rapidly just before landing.",

      "paragraph": "That’s where the Thrust-Wing Coordination Control system, or TWCC, comes in. This framework constantly assesses whether deploying the wings would help or hinder the drone’s movement. When the onboard controller predicts that a maneuver would exceed the drone’s pitch or roll limits, it signals the wings to deploy, enhancing the available force without pushing the drone into instability.",

It could climb and brake with minimal drift. In one test, it zipped through turns at 7.3 meters per second (roughly 26 km/h) and still improved its trajectory tracking by nearly a meter compared to the wingless version.",
