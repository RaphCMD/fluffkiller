      "paragraph": "In the experiment, 128 participants foraged for rewards in a modified game, searching for resources hidden in blocks. Blasting a block apart would occasionally reveal a pumpkin or watermelon, a prize marked by blue floating circles that formed a flare visible to other players. There were two versions of the game: In one, the treats were randomly distributed. In the other, prizes were clustered, so that when a player found a pumpkin, odds were good that other pumpkins were nearby. In this version, it paid off to search where other people had success.",

      "paragraph": "Players either searched alone or in a group of four on either type of game. The best foragers, researchers found, fluidly shifted strategies, both when searching alone or with others. Working alone in an environment where rewards were clustered, for instance, a player might spend more time searching near the spot where a pumpkin had just been found. But when the rewards were randomly spread out, the player would move farther afield from a previous reward. Shifts in strategy occurred when players were searching in a group, too; players smartly figured out which player to copy.",

This new study shows that people use much more complex strategies, she says.",
