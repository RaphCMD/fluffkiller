    "Network science and artificial intelligence can identify food molecules that negatively affect health as well as alleviate disease by proposing dietary changes, a Northeastern expert says.",
    "Since the human genome was decoded in 2003, Albert-László Barabási — a distinguished professor of physics at Northeastern University and director of the Center for Complex Network Research — has used network science to map out connections between proteins in human cells. “That’s where network medicine comes in,” Barabási says."
