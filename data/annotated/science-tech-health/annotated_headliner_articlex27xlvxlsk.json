    "Scientists have unlocked a new way to make solar panels far more efficient—up to 1,000 times better than current methods. The team at a German university achieved this by engineering ultra-thin, layered materials that respond to light in powerful new ways.",
    "At the heart of the breakthrough is a crystal sandwich. Scientists stacked layers of barium titanate, strontium titanate, and calcium titanate into a lattice structure. These materials, arranged with precision, created a new kind of solar absorber."
