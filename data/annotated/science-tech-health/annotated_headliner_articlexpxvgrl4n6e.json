The brain creates these stress hormones, she says, \"so that when our partner leaves or sort of disappears, we get so agitated that we are motivated to go find them or feel so grateful when they come back.\" In other words, we're biologically primed from the start to feel stress when a relationship ends.",

Seven years later, we got married, so we were together actually a total of 32 years, or my entire adult life. I guess the start of the dissolution came one evening before friends were coming to dinner. He handed me his phone to look at an email from his brother. Only there was a different email on his phone, and it was a love note to another woman. I would say that was probably the worst night of my life. I was in the middle of reading the email when the friends walked in the front door, so I had to kind of plaster a smile on my face and get through this dinner before I was able to investigate a little bit further. ...",

I couldn't tell which molecule was me and which was someone else. I had this clear revelation that all our emotions are just molecules. It's so funny that we take them so seriously. ...
