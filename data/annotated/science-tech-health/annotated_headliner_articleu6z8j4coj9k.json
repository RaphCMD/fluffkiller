      "paragraph": "The caterpillar, a member of the Hawaiian Fancy Case Caterpillar group also known as the genus Hyposmocoma, has been named the “bone collector” caterpillar due to its macabre habit of adding insect body parts into its silken, portable case. Researchers have observed these caterpillars measuring and attaching body parts such as fly wings, weevil heads and earwig abdomens to their cases.",

This is something we never even imagined was possible. But in Hawaiʻi, here it is.”",
