    "Hunger is a powerful force essential for survival, driving individuals to seek out food. For early humans, it fueled purposeful movement as they hunted prey and gathered plants over long distances. Today, that drive has mostly shifted to foraging in grocery stores or gardens. But hunger is only one side of the coin—the other is satiation, the feeling of fullness that signals it’s time to stop eating, and it is just as important for maintaining energy balance.",
    "The hypothalamus is traditionally viewed as the primary control center for managing hunger and satiety, processing information about taste, digestive hormones, and nutrient levels. But recent research suggests that other regions, such as the brainstem, also play a role in controlling appetite, although the exact mechanisms are unclear.1 This insight inspired Alexander Nectow, a neuroscientist at Columbia University, to investigate the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), a small area in the brainstem."

      "paragraph": "Until recently, characterizing the various cell types in the DRN was a challenge due to the region’s molecular and spatial diversity. But using a new single-cell molecular profiling technique, Nectow and his team uncovered previously unknown neurons in the DRN that expressed hormones related to appetite, suggesting a role in regulating satiety. Published in Cell, their findings revealed that unlike other known satiation-related cells, which respond to singular cues, these DRN neurons integrate multiple signals and act as the final decision-making that tell the body when to stop eating.2 This discovery sheds new light on the biology of satiation and could pave the way for innovative treatments for obesity.",

      "paragraph": "Consistent with this, the mice gradually decreased food intake within the first half of meal, suggesting that CCK neurons produce a delayed satiety signal that gradually curbs appetite and ends the meal. “In order for that delay to exist, these neurons have to hold on to the memory of the fact that they need to have that action,” explained Nectow.
