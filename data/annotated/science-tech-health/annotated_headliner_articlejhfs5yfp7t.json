  "context": [
    "An international team led by the University of Geneva (UNIGE) has discovered the most distant known spiral galaxy to date. This ultra-massive system, shaped like a flattened disk, existed just one billion years after the Big Bang—very early in the cosmic timeline. Yet, it already displays a remarkably mature structure, featuring an ancient central bulge, a large star-forming disk, and well-defined spiral arms.",
    "This discovery, published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, was made possible thanks to data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). It provides new insights into the formation and early evolution of galaxies in the primordial Universe."

      "paragraph": "Large spiral galaxies like the Milky Way were thought to take several billion years to form. Thus, during the first billion years of cosmic history, scientists expected to observe only small, chaotic, and irregularly shaped galaxies. However, JWST is beginning to reveal alternative scenarios. Its deep infrared imaging has uncovered surprisingly massive and well-structured galaxies much earlier than predicted, prompting astronomers to reconsider when and how galaxies took shape in the early Universe.",

It was observed at a redshift corresponding to just one billion years after the Big Bang. Despite this early epoch, the galaxy exhibits an astonishingly mature structure: an old central bulge, a large star-forming disk, and spiral arms—features typically seen in galaxies much farther removed from the Big Bang.",
