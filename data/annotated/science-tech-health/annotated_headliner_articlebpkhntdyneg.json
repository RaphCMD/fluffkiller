    "Researchers from McGill University in Montreal, in collaboration with Mexican scientists, have identified two previously unknown crocodile species inhabiting two islands off the Yucatán Peninsula.",
    "Found on the renowned tourist island of Cozumel and within the Banco Chinchorro Biosphere Reserve 210 kilometers to the south, both new species remain unnamed, pending formal taxonomic description."
