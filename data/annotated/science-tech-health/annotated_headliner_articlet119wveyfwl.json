  "context": [
    "An unprecedented experiment seven years in the making has shaken the field of neuroscience. Researchers set out to answer one of science’s most puzzling questions: Where does consciousness come from? After decades of speculation and debate, two leading theories were put head-to-head in a massive collaboration. The results didn’t produce a clear winner—but they did challenge long-held assumptions and reshape how experts understand the mind.",
    "The study brought together two groups of researchers with very different beliefs about consciousness. One side supports Integrated Information Theory, or IIT. The other backs Global Neuronal Workspace Theory, or GNWT. Instead of debating endlessly, the two teams joined forces—along with independent, neutral scientists—to test their ideas using a large, carefully planned experiment."

These plans were shared publicly before any testing began to avoid bias. “Adversarial collaboration fits within the Allen Institute’s mission of team science, open science and big science,” said Christof Koch, Ph.D., a long-time researcher in consciousness studies.",

      "paragraph": "The experiment involved 256 participants—an unusually large number for this type of brain research. Each person viewed clear visual images for varying lengths of time while scientists recorded their brain activity. To get a full picture, they used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG).",

      "paragraph": "Integrated Information Theory suggests that consciousness comes from how deeply connected different parts of the brain are. The idea is that the brain becomes conscious when its areas work as one, with a high level of information shared across the system. This integration, called \"phi,\" is thought to peak in a \"hot zone\" located in the back of the brain—specifically in the parietal, temporal, and occipital regions.",

      "paragraph": "Global Neuronal Workspace Theory presents a very different view. It says consciousness emerges when information is widely shared across many areas, especially the front of the brain. This “ignition” process involves the prefrontal cortex, which helps broadcast information and make it accessible for things like memory, decision-making, and attention.",

      "paragraph": "The data showed that certain areas of the brain, such as the visual and temporal cortex, consistently reflected what people were consciously seeing. These responses were sustained in some regions, like the occipital and lateral temporal cortex, depending on how long the images were shown. The study also found that parts of the frontal brain areas were synchronized with early visual regions, suggesting some form of communication between what you see and how you think about it.",

      "paragraph": "For IIT, the prediction that the back of the brain should show strong, lasting connections didn’t fully hold up. While there was some activity in that area, it wasn’t as integrated or as long-lasting as the theory expected.
