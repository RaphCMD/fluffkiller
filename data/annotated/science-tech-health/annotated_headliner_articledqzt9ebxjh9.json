    "He has self-administered more than 850 doses of venom from cobras, mambas, rattlesnakes and other deadly species in pursuit of a singular quest: to develop immunity to snake bites in the hope of helping scientists create a universal antivenom.",
    "Now the extreme 18-year experiment by Tim Friede, a former truck mechanic from Wisconsin, appears to have paid off. Scientists have used antibodies from his blood to create the most broadly protective antivenom to date, which could revolutionise the treatment of snake bites."

      "paragraph": "“For a period of nearly 18 years, [Tim] had undertaken hundreds of bites and self-immunisations with escalating doses from 16 species of very lethal snakes that would normally a kill a horse,” said Jacob Glanville, the chief executive of the US biotech Centivax and first author of the research. “It blew my mind. I contacted him because I thought if anyone in the world has these properly neutralising antibodies, it’s him.”",

While effective, there is a risk of severe adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis, to the non-human antibodies. And treatments tend to be species- and sometimes region-specific.",

After isolating candidate antibodies from Friede’s blood, they tested these out in mice envenomated from each species. This allowed them to identify just two antibodies that, when combined with a synthetic antivenom, provided complete protection against 13 of the species and partial protection against the others.",
