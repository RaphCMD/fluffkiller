  "headline": "Navigating the trust gap: three Research Topics on tech, AI, and the future of public confidence in science",
  "context": [
    "Technological advancements have changed how we consume and interact with information. Social media, search engines, and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered algorithms make knowledge accessible at an unprecedented scale. However, these developments have also created new opportunities for misinformation and manipulation, ultimately undermining public trust in institutions, including scientific ones.",
    "In the information age, fostering trust and confidence among the public –particularly in the science community—prompted a community of scientists to establish the Research Topic The Erosion of Trust in the 21st Century: Origins, Implications, and Solutions. Inspired by the work of this group of researchers, we’ve curated three Research Topics that investigate the complex interplay between technology, health, and society's trust in scientific research."
