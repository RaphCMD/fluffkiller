    "For centuries, scientists believed that only the elite were buried in pyramids. But a surprising recent discovery of ancient skeletons has thrown that idea into question.",
    "In a new study, researchers analysed the remains of people buried in Tombos, an archaeological site located in modern-day Sudan, bordering Egypt."

      "paragraph": "Around 3,500 years ago, the ancient town of Tombos sat along the Nile River in a region called Nubia, which had been conquered by the Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose I (he ruled about 170 years before Tutankhamun).",

      "paragraph": "Archaeologists analysed skeletons from several different burial sites at Tombos, looking for subtle marks where muscles and ligaments had been attached to the bones. These traces – called entheseal changes – can give archaeologists clues about how a person’s life physically altered their bones.",
