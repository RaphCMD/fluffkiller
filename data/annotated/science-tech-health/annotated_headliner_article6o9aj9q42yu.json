      "paragraph": "You’ve probably seen a cat or dog swing their ears toward a sound. We can’t move our fairly rigid ears this dramatically. But people still possess ancient ear-moving muscles. Some of us can even wiggle our ears on demand. And, it now turns out, they’re more active than anyone knew.",

      "paragraph": "Andreas Schröer is an ear-muscle expert. An ear wiggler himself, he’s also a neuroscientist at Saarland University. That’s in Saarbrücken, Germany. Schröer was part of a team that asked 20 people with normal hearing to listen to a recorded voice. Meanwhile, distracting podcasts played in the background. Electrodes around the volunteers’ ears recorded their muscle activity.",

      "paragraph": "Millions of years ago, this muscle may have helped our ancestors home in on sounds. But modern humans don’t wiggle their ears all that much. Today, it’s doubtful that this tiny wisp of muscle action helps us hear better (though scientists haven’t tested that). “It does its best, but it probably doesn’t work,” Schröer says.",
