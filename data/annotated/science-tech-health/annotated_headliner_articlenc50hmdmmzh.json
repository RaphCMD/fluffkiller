      "paragraph": "Huntington’s disease arises from a genetic mutation that results in an abnormal expansion of the CAG trinucleotide sequence in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. This mutation causes the huntingtin protein to develop a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract that aggregates into amyloid fibrils. Unlike the fibrils associated with Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s diseases, those formed by polyQ proteins present unique structural challenges.",
