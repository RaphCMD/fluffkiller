      "paragraph": "The asteroid’s unusual shape startled all scientific personnel. The unexpected assembly consists of two nested ice cream cone-like forms united through an abnormally contoured constricted linkage, thus producing an unexpected space structure. The strategic exploration method enables the team to progress through encounters sequentially while developing better operational procedures. Analysts believe this distinct structure indicates multiple ancient collisions between space objects that took place around 150 million years ago.",
