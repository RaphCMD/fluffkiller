  "context": [
    "A rodent-sized mammal found in east Alabama is causing a stir across the state and beyond. Researchers at Auburn University are part of a team that has identified the first henipavirus in North America — in the tissue of a northern short-tailed shrew. The discovery was published this week in the journal “Emerging Infectious Diseases” and has since made national headlines.",
    "Scientists say while viruses always bring some level of uncertainty, there is no evidence that the newly identified virus is able to infect humans."

There is no data that indicates that this particular virus has been detected in humans or could jump from this species of shrew or any other animal in the U.S. to humans.”",
