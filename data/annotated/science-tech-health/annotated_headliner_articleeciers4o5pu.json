    "A mysterious disease that has plagued sea stars for more than a decade may have met its match in the fjords of British Columbia.",
    "Sunflower sea stars discovered thriving in the frigid waters suggest that cooler temperatures provide protection from sea star wasting disease, or SSWD. The finding, reported in the April Proceedings of the Royal Society B, is a valuable clue about what causes SSWD in the first place, researchers say."

      "paragraph": "Sea star wasting disease has stumped scientists since the first big outbreak emerged in 2013 off North America’s Pacific coast. “We initially thought it was a virus, but went back on that, because the data was either flawed or the results couldn’t be repeated,” says Ian Hewson, a marine ecologist at Cornell University who was not involved in the new study. His follow-up research into possible microbial or environmental causes has been inconclusive.",

      "paragraph": "That’s important because sea stars help keep ecosystems in check. For instance, sunflower sea stars are one of the primary predators of sea urchins. In their absence, “urchins will completely mow down kelp forests,” that serve as crucial habitats for many species, says marine ecologist Alyssa Gehman of the Haikai Institute in British Columbia.",

      "paragraph": "Gehman learned of the refuge population from her colleague Tristan Blaine, a field biologist with the Central Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance. In 2016, the First Nations Coastal Guardian Watchmen reported seeing giant sea stars in their traps while surveying for Dungeness crabs, Blaine says. To look for the sea stars, he dove fjords near Bella Coola, a town in Nuxalk First Nations territory. “The fjords are colder than anywhere else on the coast. It’s super dark and there’s usually blasting current,” Blaine says. But the water was full of life, including “sea stars that are disappearing everywhere [else],” he says.",

      "paragraph": "Twisted arms, lesions and disintegrating bodies told the scientists that SSWD had been in the fjords. But not to the extent that it showed up in the islands. Fjord populations were healthier and had more adults than those around the islands. SSWD, which becomes more threatening the larger that sea stars get, prevented the islands’ sea stars from reaching adulthood, the researchers say.",

      "paragraph": "Logging water temperature, salinity and oxygen levels hinted at why SSWD didn’t devastate the fjord population. Within the fjords, sea stars were most abundant in patches of cooler, deeper, saltier water. It’s likely that the sea stars sought out these areas as snow melt formed a warmer, fresher water layer on the surface. On the other hand, sea stars in the outer islands were most abundant in warmer water.",
