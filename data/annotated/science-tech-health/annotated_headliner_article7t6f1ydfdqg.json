  "context": [
    "Excavated amidst the stone walls and forest in the rural area of the municipality of Sant'Ana do Livramento, in Rio Grande do Sul, the tunnel appears to have been built by human hands and minds. However, palaeontologists point out that this rock formation, known as a palaeoburrow, may have been a shelter and habitat for gigantic animals that occupied the region at least 11 thousand years ago. Specimens of extinct fauna, such as the giant sloth, but which continue to fascinate and intrigue scientists.",
    "“These large xenarthrans (mammals originating from South America), such as the giant sloth, had shapes that could reach up to five or six metres in height. They could be ungulates, these ancient and large relatives of armadillos, they could be giant armadillos. But we cannot rule out the possibility of it being some carnivore\", says Ana Maria Ribeiro, palaeontologist at the Rio Grande do Sul Natural Sciences Museum, when considering what type of animal may have originated the prehistoric cave."

The most recent scientific visit to the site was carried out earlier this year with the aim of better mapping the tunnel and collecting more traces of the presence of animals that passed through and lived in the space. Similar to the palaeoburrow in question, other structures have been mapped in Sant'Ana do Livramento and surrounding areas.",
