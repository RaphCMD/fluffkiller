  "context": [
    "Nestled close to the summit of an underwater mountain west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge lies a mysterious and striking landscape—the Lost City. Discovered in 2000, this hydrothermal field is home to towering structures that rise from the ocean’s depths, forming a unique environment never seen anywhere else on Earth. With help from the University of Washington’s Lost City Research, scientists have continued to explore the wonders of this underwater “city”. Located over 700 meters beneath the surface, the Lost City is a living testament to the power of hydrothermal venting, home to bizarre microbial communities that may offer insight into the origins of life itself.",
    "The Lost City Hydrothermal Field is renowned for being one of the longest-lived venting environments, where the upthrusting mantle reacts with seawater to release hydrogen, methane, and other gases for over 120,000 years. This process creates a rich environment, feeding microbial communities that thrive without the need for oxygen. These unusual hydrocarbon-fueled ecosystems exist deep within the cracks and crevices of the field’s vents, which expel gases at temperatures of up to 40°C (104°F). While large creatures are rare, snails, crustaceans, and other smaller life forms flourish, showing that life can thrive even in the most extreme environments."

      "paragraph": "“This is an example of a type of ecosystem that could be active on Enceladus or Europa right this second,” William Brazelton, a microbiologist, remarked in 2018. These moons of Saturn and Jupiter, like the Lost City, may host similar conditions where life could exist today. “And maybe Mars in the past,” he added, suggesting that the environment found in the Lost City could also shed light on how life might have once existed on other planets.",

      "paragraph": "One of the key breakthroughs in studying the Lost City came in 2024 when researchers extracted a 1,268-meter-long core sample of mantle rock. This core could provide crucial evidence on how life emerged on Earth billions of years ago, under conditions similar to those in the Lost City. The hydrothermal activity here, which produces hydrocarbons from chemical reactions on the seafloor, may resemble the early processes that supported life on Earth long before the arrival of sunlight or atmospheric carbon dioxide. Scientists are eager to understand how life could have originated in this unique setting, as the hydrocarbons produced here are the building blocks of life itself.",

      "paragraph": "While the Lost City remains a beacon of scientific exploration, it faces significant threats from human activity. In 2018, it was reported that Poland had won the rights to mine the deep-sea region around the Lost City. Although there are no precious resources within the thermal field itself, the disruption of the surrounding habitat could have unforeseen consequences. “Any plumes or discharges triggered by the mining could easily wash over the remarkable habitat,” scientists warn.",
