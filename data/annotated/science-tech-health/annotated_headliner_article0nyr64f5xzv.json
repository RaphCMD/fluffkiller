    "Scientists from The University of Manchester have changed our understanding  of how cells in living organisms divide, which could revise what students are taught at school.",
    "In a Wellcome funded study published today (01/05/25) in Science - one of the world’s leading scientific journals – the researchers challenge conventional wisdom taught in schools for over 100 years."

    {
      "paragraph": "Students are currently taught that during cell division, a ‘parent’ cell will become spherical before splitting into two ‘daughter’ cells of equal size and shape.",
      "reason": "Provides background on the traditional understanding of cell division.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "However, the study reveals that cell rounding is not a universal feature of cell division and is not how it often works in the body.",
      "reason": "Introduces the new findings that challenge the traditional view.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Dividing cells, they show, often don’t round up into sphere-like shapes. This lack of rounding breaks the symmetry of division to generate two daughter cells that differ from each other in both size and function, known as asymmetric division.",
      "reason": "Explains the new concept of asymmetric division discovered by the study.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Asymmetric divisions are an important way that the different types of cells in the body are generated, to make different tissues and organs.",

      "paragraph": "Until now, asymmetric cell division has predominantly only been associated with highly specialised cells, known as stem cells.",
      "reason": "Highlights the previous understanding of asymmetric cell division.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "The scientists found that it is the shape of a parent cell before it even divides that can determine if they will round or not in division and determines how symmetric, or not, its daughter cells are going to be.",
      "reason": "This paragraph introduces a key finding of the research, directly related to the headline.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Cells which are shorter and wider in shape tend to round up and divide into two cells which are similar to each other.  However, cells which are longer and thinner don’t round up and divide asymmetrically, so that one daughter is different to the other.",

      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "The findings could have far reaching implications on our understanding of the role of cell division in disease. For example, in the context of cancer cells, this type of ‘non-round’, asymmetric division could generate different cell behaviours known to promote cancer progression through metastasis.",

      "paragraph": "“Students learn that when a cell divides, it will generate a uniform spherical shape. Our study, however, shows that in real living organisms, it is not as simple as that.",

      "paragraph": "“Our research suggests that the shape of the cell before it divides can fundamentally direct whether a cell rounds, and importantly, if its daughters are symmetric or asymmetric both in size and function.”",

      "paragraph": "When the fast moving “tip” cell divided, the study showed, it didn’t “round-up” as expected. In doing so it was able to divide asymmetrically and generate the new fast “tip” cell at the front and a slower following cell behind it.",
