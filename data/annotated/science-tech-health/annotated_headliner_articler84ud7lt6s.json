      "paragraph": "His discovery marked the creation of the field of endocrine physiology and subsequently advanced understanding of transcription networks and identified previously unknown nuclear receptors and ligands. This breakthrough ultimately led to the development of new drugs to treat human illnesses ranging from leukemia to liver disease, inflammation, type 2 diabetes and cancer.",

      "paragraph": "During his lecture, Evans detailed his journey as a scientist and his lab’s characterization of the complete structure of the human glucocorticoid receptor, which led to the discovery of a nuclear receptor superfamily for steroids, vitamins A and D, thyroid hormone, bile acids, fatty acids and cholesterol metabolites. These hormones activate transcriptional networks that control sugar, salt, calcium and fat metabolism, thereby influencing daily health and unlocking new avenues for the treatment of disease.",

      "paragraph": "Building on earlier discoveries, Evans’ laboratory is now exploring the role of PPAR-delta—a nuclear receptor involved in lipid and glucose metabolism—in exercise and endurance. Their research suggests that drugs targeting this receptor could enhance physical performance in mice. By suppressing glucose metabolism and compelling the body to burn fat instead, these drugs may enable non-athletically trained mice to outperform their trained counterparts in endurance tests. The approach could be dubbed “exercise in a pill,” Evans said.",

      "paragraph": "“These cortical receptors turned out to be a paradigm shift in science in health and have led to major advancements,” Evans said. “We started off with a receptor, but now we’ve really transitioned into a different way of thinking about how we interact with our environment and how we can take advantage of that knowledge. We’re working out entirely physiologic mechanisms, new aspects of science and new generations of therapeutics.”",
