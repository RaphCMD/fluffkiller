  "context": [
    "Super-Earths, larger planets similar to Earth, are far more common across the universe than scientists previously believed, according to a groundbreaking microlensing study using KMTNet telescopes.",
    "Researchers discovered that these planets can orbit their stars at vast distances, similar to gas giants like Jupiter, hinting at a hidden abundance of alien worlds. Using rare cosmic alignments and light anomalies, the team not only found new planets but also began piecing together the mysterious processes of planet formation, fueled by international collaborations and innovative telescope technology."

    {
      "paragraph": "By analyzing subtle light distortions caused by a newly detected planet’s host star—and comparing their findings with a larger dataset from KMTNet’s microlensing survey—the researchers found that super-Earths can exist at distances from their stars similar to how far our gas giants are from the Sun, explained Andrew Gould, co-author of the study and professor emeritus of astronomy at The Ohio State University.",

      "paragraph": "“Scientists knew there were more small planets than big planets, but in this study, we were able to show that within this overall pattern, there are excesses and deficits,” he said. “It’s very interesting.”",

    {
      "paragraph": "Although planets that orbit close to their stars are relatively easy to detect, finding those with wider, more distant orbits is much harder. Even so, the team estimated that for every three stars in the galaxy, there is likely at least one super-Earth with a long, Jupiter-like orbital period. Their findings suggest these massive, rocky planets may be a widespread feature of planetary systems throughout the cosmos—a conclusion Gould says helps advance the growing field of planetary microlensing he helped pioneer.",

      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "The findings in this study were made via microlensing, an observational effect that occurs when the presence of mass warps the fabric of space-time to a detectable degree. When a foreground object, such as a star or planet, passes between an observer and a more distant star, light is curved from the source, causing an apparent increase in the object’s brightness that can last anywhere from a few hours to several months.",

      "paragraph": "Astronomers can use these fluctuations, or bumps, in brightness to help locate alien worlds unlike our own. In this case, microlensing signals were used to locate OGLE-2016-BLG-0007, a super-Earth with a mass ratio roughly double that of Earth’s and an orbit wider than Saturn’s.",

      "paragraph": "These observations allowed the team to divide exoplanets into two groups, one that consists of super-Earths and Neptune-like planets and the other comprising gas giants like Jupiter or Saturn. This discovery opens new doors for planetary system science: Having a better understanding of exoplanet distribution can reveal new insights about the processes by which they form and evolve.",

      "paragraph": "To explain their results, researchers also compared their findings to predictions made from theoretical simulations of planet formation. Their results showed that while exoplanets can be separated into groups by mass and makeup, the mechanisms that may produce them can vary.",

Now, with the help of three powerful custom-built telescopes located in South Africa, Chile and Australia, the KMTNet system routinely allows scientists to scour the cosmos for these amazing events, said Pogge.",

And as technology continues to evolve, having dedicated, global collaborations like this one will turn visions of scientific theory into real discoveries, said Pogge.",
