    "A tiny piece of space rock has revealed that life on Earth may have come from an asteroid – and hints that extraterrestrial life is one step closer than we thought.",
    "Five years ago, a daring NASA mission known as OSIRIS-REx intersected Bennu, an asteroid on a near-collision course with Earth, grabbing a small sample of it in the process. In late 2023, a tiny capsule containing 120g (4oz) of the asteroid landed in the Utah desert, in the US."
