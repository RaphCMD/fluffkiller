      "paragraph": "The tech industry is already full of demonstrations of the capabilities of what it calls agentic AI, though few are yet found in the real world. Most are still refashioned versions of large language models — the generative AI technology behind chatbots that can write emails, summarize documents or help people code. Trained on huge troves of data, they can scour the internet and bring back recommendations for things to buy, but they have a harder time going beyond that.",

      "paragraph": "Many consumers are already getting used to digital payment systems such as Apple Pay that turn their phones into a credit card.
