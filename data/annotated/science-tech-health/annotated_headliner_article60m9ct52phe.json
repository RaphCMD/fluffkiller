  "headline": "Horrifying Discovery At Pompeii Reveals How Family Of Four Tried To Save Themselves | IFLScience",
  "context": [
    "As red-hot volcanic rocks rained down on the ancient city of Pompeii in 79 CE, the inhabitants of one house made the fatal decision to barricade themselves inside a bedroom. Two millennia later, the remains of these four sorry individuals have been discovered, along with a series of other items which help to tell the story of their agonizing deaths.",
    "The quartet were found in the so-called House of Elle and Frisso, which takes its name from a painting of a mythological scene on the wall of one of the rooms. Appropriately tragic, the artwork depicts the final moments of a young girl named Elle as she desperately reaches for the hand of her brother while drowning."

Sadly for them, the ejection of lapilli was just the first phase of the eruption, and was followed by a scorching cloud of volcanic gas and debris known as a pyroclastic flow, which engulfed Pompeii and the nearby town of Herculaneum, killing everyone who hadn’t managed to evacuate.",
