    "Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have detected the first planet seen orbiting a dead star, offering new insights into how planets evolve during the final stages of a star's life.",
    "The James Webb Space Telescope's observations of the exoplanet, named WD 1856+534 b, also confirm it is the coldest exoplanet to date, which could pave the way for the first detailed atmospheric studies of gas giant exoplanets and help us contextualize our solar system on a cosmic scale."

      "paragraph": "WD 1856+534 b, a Jupiter-size world located about 80 light-years from Earth, was first discovered in 2020. It orbits a white dwarf — the remnant core of a once sun-like star — every 1.4 days. Initially, scientists were unsure whether the object was a planet or a brown dwarf, the so-called \"failed stars\" of the universe, because they only had limited temperature data about it from the now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope. New data from the JWST, however, have now provided far more sensitive measurements, enabling astronomers to directly detect the planet's light and measure its mass and temperature.",
