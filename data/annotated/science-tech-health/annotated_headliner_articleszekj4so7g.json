      "paragraph": "Combining the automated and robust Proteograph XT workflow for nanoparticle-based protein enrichment with the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer’s sensitivity and speed of analysis enables unprecedented deep proteomic profiling of plasma samples and other biofluids. Together, these breakthrough technologies allow for the characterisation of more than 8,000 proteins across a human plasma study and between 60,000 and 70,000 peptides per sample, a significant leap from conventional methods that typically detect and quantify around 1,500 proteins in plasma. Seer’s Proteograph XT workflow includes the Proteograph XT nanoparticle assay and the SP100 Automation Instrument, offering minimal hands-on time for sample prep so a single user can process up to 400 samples each week. Also included in the workflow is the Proteograph Analysis Suite for robust data analysis in large-scale proteomic studies.",
