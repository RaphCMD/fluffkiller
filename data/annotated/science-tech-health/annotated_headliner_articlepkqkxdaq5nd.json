    "A distant flicker of light from a star can reveal more than you might expect. In fact, a brief, subtle brightening in the sky has helped scientists uncover something astonishing: planets much like Earth, called super-Earths, may be far more common than once thought—and they’re hiding in the dark outskirts of distant solar systems.",
    "This revelation comes from a method known as gravitational microlensing. It’s a rare cosmic event that happens when a star, or sometimes even a planet, drifts into perfect alignment between Earth and a more distant star."

      "paragraph": "Scientists have long used microlensing to spot massive gas giants like Jupiter or Saturn orbiting far from their host stars. But catching smaller planets—like those between the size of Earth and Neptune—has been harder. These smaller worlds don’t shine on their own. And their gravitational effects are so brief and faint that they often get lost in the noise.",

Each night, these telescopes take dozens of images of the same star fields. Together, they build a full, near-continuous picture of the sky. This allows scientists to catch the fleeting signatures of planets passing by.",

Using KMTNet, researchers recently detected a super-Earth orbiting a star beyond Saturn’s distance from the Sun. This planet, part of an event called OGLE-2016-BLG-0007, had a mass ratio about twice that of Earth’s. That makes it a rare find—and an important one.",

      "paragraph": "It’s more than interesting—it’s game-changing. By grouping planets this way, researchers now believe these categories reflect different birth stories. One likely grows through core accretion, where dust clumps together until it becomes massive enough to attract gas. The other may result from gravitational instability, where a swirling disk of gas collapses rapidly to form a giant.",

Based on the findings, for every three stars in the galaxy, at least one may have a super-Earth on a wide orbit—something like Jupiter’s. That means our solar system, once considered special, may be less unique than we thought.",

The data points to a bimodal distribution, where planets tend to clump into two different groups rather than being spread evenly. This split likely reflects the diverse ways that planetary systems evolve.",
