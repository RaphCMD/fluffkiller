  "context": [
    "A groundbreaking discovery from Israeli scientists is changing what doctors know about inherited heart disease. Researchers have pinpointed a gene, TRIM63, as a major contributor to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common inherited heart condition around the world.",
    "The study was led by Dr. Noa Ruhrman Shahar of Rabin Medical Center (Beilinson Hospital) and Professor Shay Ben-Shachar of the Clalit Research Institute. Their work strengthens the evidence that TRIM63 not only causes HCM but also greatly increases a person's risk of developing it."

      "paragraph": "In a detailed analysis, the team studied 107 unrelated patients diagnosed with HCM. They used advanced exome-based gene panels, a method that captures a wide range of genetic information. Patients came from diverse backgrounds, including Ashkenazi Jews, Muslim Arabs, and North African and Middle Eastern Jewish communities.",

      "paragraph": "The results revealed that about 4.7% of these patients carried two faulty copies of the TRIM63 gene, a situation known as biallelic mutation. This group represented 18.5% of all those who received a genetic diagnosis during the study. These individuals developed heart muscle thickening at an early age, experienced frequent arrhythmias, and suffered from repeated fainting spells. Some even needed implantable cardioverter defibrillators before doctors knew their condition was genetic.",

    {
      "paragraph": "Additionally, the researchers found that 7.5% of the patients carried only one faulty copy of the gene. When compared to a group of people without heart disease, these single-copy carriers were 8.2 times more likely to have HCM. This strongly suggested that even having one bad copy of TRIM63 puts people at high risk.",
      "reason": "This paragraph adds important data about the risk associated with carrying one faulty gene copy.",

      "paragraph": "An unexpected finding was a mutation called c.277C>T, previously unknown to scientists. It showed up in several patients of Libyan Jewish descent. The team estimated the disease frequency for this group at about one in 14,400 individuals. The discovery points to the importance of targeted genetic screening in specific populations where marrying within the community is common.",

      "paragraph": "The new research removes much of that doubt. It provides strong evidence that TRIM63 needs to be part of genetic screening, especially for groups already shown to carry higher risks. Including TRIM63 would not only help spot cases earlier but also help tailor treatment to each person's specific needs.",

      "paragraph": "The study also showcased the benefits of exome-based genetic testing over older methods. Exome testing allows doctors to keep updating their analysis as new genetic links are discovered. Traditional gene-specific panels can quickly become outdated, missing critical information like the connection to TRIM63.",

      "paragraph": "Adding TRIM63 to standard HCM testing could lead to important improvements in medical care. Doctors could diagnose patients earlier and offer special surveillance for family members who might also carry risky genes. Treatment plans could then be personalized based on each person's exact genetic profile.",

It drew on resources from the Clalit Research Institute and Rabin Medical Center, among others. The work was supported by Clalit Health Services, the largest healthcare provider in Israel. Clalit’s genomic database, one of the country’s most diverse, was essential to identifying the TRIM63 connection.",
