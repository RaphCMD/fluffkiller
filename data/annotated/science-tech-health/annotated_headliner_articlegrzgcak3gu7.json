    "A vast cloud of hydrogen gas – one of the largest single structures ever observed in the sky – has been discovered surprisingly close to Earth.",
    "Named Eos after the Greek goddess of the dawn, the cloud was detected because of its faint far-ultraviolet light naturally emitted by hydrogen molecules."
