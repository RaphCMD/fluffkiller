      "paragraph": "The planet, named WASP-121b, has been dubbed an \"ultra-hot Jupiter\" that orbits so close to its star that each year lasts only 30 of our hours on Earth. This creates extreme weather conditions that have fascinated astronomers, marking a major breakthrough for our understanding of the atmosphere and weather of alien worlds.",

It feels like something out of science fiction,” says Julia Victoria Seidel, a researcher at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and lead author of the study.",

    {
      "paragraph": "New research reveals that WASP-121b, also known as Tylos, has an atmosphere formed of distinct layers. In the deepest layer, iron-rich gases flow from the scorching side to its cooler side. Above this is a vast jet stream that violently churns the atmosphere up as it crosses the side of the planet that is always facing its sun. An outer layer contains hydrogen gas and is influenced by the jet stream's movement.",

      "paragraph": "“What we found was surprising: a jet stream rotates material around the planet’s equator, while a separate flow at lower levels of the atmosphere moves gas from the hot side to the cooler side. This kind of climate has never been seen before on any planet,” Dr Seidel said. “Even the strongest hurricanes in the Solar System seem calm in comparison.”",

Previous discoveries on alien planets, such as WASP-127b, have recorded wind speeds of up to 32,000 kilometres per hour, but it seems Tylos' jet stream shatters these records.",
