  "headline": "Scientists Uncover Shockingly Well-Preserved Pregnant Ichthyosaur Fossil",
  "context": [
    "A 131-year-old pregnant ichthyosaur, known as Fiona, has provided researchers with a rare glimpse into the paleobiology and paleoecology of ancient marine reptiles. Fiona’s fossilized remains, which were airlifted from Patagonia and brought to the Natural History Museum Río Seco in Chile, have been studied by an international team. The research published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology reveals how Fiona’s body was preserved, including her unborn baby and last meal—small fish remains found inside her ribcage.",
    "The study highlights Fiona’s role as a dominant predator of her time, and researchers have gained valuable insights into the environment she inhabited, as well as her reproductive strategies. Her remarkable preservation—buried after striking the seafloor and being quickly covered by sediments—has given scientists a clearer picture of how these marine reptiles lived and how the surrounding tectonic changes impacted their ecosystems."
