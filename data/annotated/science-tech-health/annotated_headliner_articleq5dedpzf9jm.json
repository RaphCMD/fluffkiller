She said: “WIMPs are theoretical particles that have never been observed directly, but they could very well be the ideal candidate for dark matter. While many of the proposed models for dark matter have been ruled out, only a few remain viable, and WIMPs are among the leading possibilities.”",

      "paragraph": "The antihelium nuclei detected by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) aboard the space station may have been produced through a process in which two WIMPs collide and annihilate each other. This annihilation could result in the creation of both matter and antimatter, along with the release of energy, a phenomenon that could help explain some of the unexplained signals observed in cosmic rays.",

      "paragraph": "Antimatter, in simple terms, can be thought of as a mirror image of regular matter. While antimatter shares the same mass as ordinary matter, its properties, such as electric charge, are opposite. For example, where a proton has a positive charge, an antiproton would have a negative charge. The interaction between matter and antimatter leads to annihilation, releasing large amounts of energy, which is why it has fascinated scientists for so long.",

While some antimatter is still being generated by high-energy cosmic events today, it is extremely difficult to detect. The universe is overwhelmingly composed of regular matter, and when antimatter is produced, it often annihilates with matter almost instantly, making it elusive to current detection methods.",

      "paragraph": "However, the detection of antihelium, a particularly rare form of antimatter, is especially noteworthy. The AMS-02, which is designed to scan cosmic rays and capture high-energy particles in space, observed antihelium nuclei in the cosmic rays it monitored. Normally, cosmic rays consist of high-energy particles like protons and heavier nuclei that travel through space, and these particles can sometimes interact with gas and dust in the interstellar medium to produce antiparticles. But theoretical models had predicted that the production of antihelium—let alone its detection—would be extraordinarily rare.",

      "paragraph": "He said: “Theoretical predictions suggested that, while cosmic rays could generate antiparticles through their interactions with the interstellar medium, the creation of antinuclei like antihelium should be incredibly scarce. We expected to detect only one antihelium event every few tens of years, but the fact that we observed around ten antihelium events was a striking result. These numbers are many orders of magnitude higher than what standard models of cosmic-ray interactions predicted.”",
