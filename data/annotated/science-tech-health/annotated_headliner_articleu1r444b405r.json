  "context": [
    "While April traditionally marks Autism Awareness Month, at the John Innes Centre (JIC), we believe in moving beyond mere awareness toward genuine affirmation and celebration of Autistic colleagues every day of the year. As part of our Understanding, Valuing and Celebrating Neurodiversity Project, we’ve been taking tangible steps to create a workplace where Autistic researchers and staff can truly thrive.",

      "paragraph": "These strengths are particularly valuable in scientific settings. While at least 20% of the general population is estimated to be Neurodivergent, research suggests this figure may be significantly higher in scientific environments. A 2024 study by ARC (Advance Research Clusters) and the University of the West of Scotland found that 48.1% of lab workers identify as Neurodivergent, compared to 20% globally. Notably, 25.5% of these individuals are Autistic, 25 times the UK average of 1%.",
