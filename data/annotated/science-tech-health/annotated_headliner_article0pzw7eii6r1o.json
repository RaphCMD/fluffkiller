    "Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi are the first dire wolves to walk the Earth in more than 10,000 years. Or so claims one biotech company and a host of recent headlines.",
    "On April 7, Colossal Biosciences announced it had achieved the “world’s first de-extinction” — an ice-age species brought back from the dead. It was referring to those three pups, all born in the last year."
