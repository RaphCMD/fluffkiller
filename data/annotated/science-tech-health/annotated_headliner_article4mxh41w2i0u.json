  "context": [
    "This year may already be on track to be the second hottest on record, after 2024. Floods and tornadoes are wracking wide swathes of the United States. And more wild weather is expected to be on the horizon.",
    "But the federal government’s ability — and long-standing charge — to warn the nation about the future impacts of climate change is in jeopardy. On April 28, the Trump administration abruptly dismissed the hundreds of U.S. scientists working on the sixth National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated interagency report. The latest report was expected to be released in 2028, but now its future is in doubt. And that could greatly hobble the nation’s ability to prepare for future climate-related extreme events."

      "paragraph": "This report is invaluable to federal, state and local governments, as well as private companies such as insurance firms. It assesses the risks of heat waves, drought, storms, floods and other climate change–exacerbated disasters and how they might impact a broad range of sectors, including health, fisheries, energy, agriculture and transportation. Extreme heat, for instance, can cause deadly heat stroke, boost mosquito-borne diseases, fuel wildfires and ruin crops.",

      "paragraph": "“The list of possible people who could make use of the information is endless,” says Reid Sherman — who, until April, was the climate adaptation lead at the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the Washington, D.C.–based organization responsible for the assessments. “That includes the scientific community, but especially all the people who are not going to be digging into scientific journals. A lot of planners or companies are worried about their risk and vulnerability.”",

      "paragraph": "The Global Change Research Program, which coordinates federal climate change research across 14 agencies to put out the assessment every few years, was largely staffed and funded through a five-year contract between NASA and the consulting firm ICF International. That contract should have lasted through spring 2026, but it was suddenly cancelled in April. Most of that program’s staff, including Sherman, were laid off, raising fears about how the assessment might go forward.",

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s press office declined an interview request on behalf of its researchers involved in the assessment, stating that “per long-standing practice, we are not discussing management matters.”",

Without it, there would be “a gap in information provision for people who have to make decisions about future planning, long-term decisions that may last 30 to 50 years,” Sherman says. That includes people in the agriculture, urban planning or transportation sectors, for example.",

The National Climate Assessment was one way FEMA could make sure it’s speaking the same language as the EPA, or the Department of Agriculture.”",
