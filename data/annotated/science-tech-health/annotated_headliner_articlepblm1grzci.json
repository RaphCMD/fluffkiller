    "PORTLAND, Ore. — OHSU released a lengthy statement this week pushing back on accusations of mistreatment at the hospital's Oregon National Primate Research Center, responding to a recent TV and social media ad campaign from the nonprofit Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) that calls for the facility to be closed down."

      "paragraph": "The center has come under increasing fire amid reports of accidents and accusations of animal mistreatment, but OHSU has rebuffed calls to shut it down, arguing that the facility employs hundreds of people and carries out life-saving research into new vaccines and treatments for chronic diseases — studies that it says cannot be carried out without animal testing.",

    {
      "paragraph": "PCRM and the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) have been among the most prominent critics of OHSU's animal research practices in recent years. PCRM began campaigning against the hospital's use of pigs for surgical training in 2022, and PETA won a lawsuit against OHSU in 2023 for concealing videos of animal experiments.",

      "paragraph": "PCRM began running its campaign in February, and Willamette Week and The Oregonian reported in March that activists were calling on Gov. Tina Kotek to make the closure a precondition for OHSU's pending merger with Legacy Health. Kotek likely doesn't have that authority, but both papers reported that she did urge OHSU to wind down the facility.",

      "paragraph": "\"Through these lenses, the public sees what OHSU carefully hides; monkeys trapped in barren metal cages barely bigger than their own bodies, living in fear, and discarded like used paper towels, while their wild kin thrive in rich forests, surrounded by family,\" Dr. Lisa Jones-Engel of PETA said in a statement. \"PETA urges OHSU to end this cruelty, shut down its failed primate center, and shift to modern, animal-free research methods.\"",

      "paragraph": "In response to claims that the facility's funding could be spent on patient care, OHSU said the vast majority of the facility's funding takes the forms of research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), along with some philanthropic sources, so the money can't be reassigned.",
