  "context": [
    "The recent discovery of an enigmatic rock formation nicknamed “Skull Hill” on Mars has sparked intense interest among NASA scientists studying the red planet. This peculiar dark-colored formation with unusual cavities has become the subject of scientific inquiry, with researchers scrambling to understand its origins and significance.",
    "In early April 2025, NASA‘s Perseverance rover was conducting routine exploration at the lower section of “Witch Hazel Hill” along the Jezero crater rim when it captured images of an unusual dark rock formation. This area of Mars is particularly significant as scientists believe it contained a deep, extensive lake approximately 3.6 billion years ago."

      "paragraph": "The rover’s cameras captured several notable rocks that appeared out of place in their current environment. Among these discoveries, one formation stood out dramatically – a dark, angular rock with mysterious depressions that NASA scientists subsequently named “Skull Hill” due to its distinctive appearance.",
      "reason": "Describes the discovery and naming of the rock formation, directly related to the headline.",

    {
      "paragraph": "“What makes this finding so intriguing is the stark contrast between this dark angular rock and the surrounding lighter-colored terrain,” explained Dr. Emily Rodriguez, a geologist on the Mars mission team. “The surface features multiple cavities that resemble eye sockets, enhancing its skull-like appearance.”",
      "reason": "Provides expert commentary on the rock's appearance and significance.",

    {
      "paragraph": "Scientists believe these unusual cavities may have formed either through erosion of embedded rock fragments or through wind-based weathering processes that have sculpted the rock over millions of years. The stark color differential suggests a completely different composition from surrounding materials.",

    {
      "paragraph": "The leading hypothesis now suggests “Skull Hill” may be volcanic in nature, possibly ejected from a distant crater during an ancient volcanic event. This would explain its dark appearance, as rocks formed from cooling magma or lava typically contain black minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite.",

      "paragraph": "Beyond the mystery of “Skull Hill” itself, these transported rocks offer valuable evidence about Mars’ dynamic past. Scientists believe these formations were moved to their current locations billions of years ago when the Martian environment was significantly warmer and wetter.",
      "reason": "Connects 'Skull Hill' to broader geological history and environmental conditions on Mars.",
