    "Great news for tea lovers — the brewing process can remove about 15% of lead from water, according to a new study.",
    "CNN summarized the research, which looked at how brewing tea could naturally adsorb heavy metals such as lead, chromium, copper, and cadmium. Adsorption is when a solid material holds molecules of a gas, liquid, or dissolved substance as a thin film on its outside surface or within internal surfaces including crevices, the news site explained."

      "paragraph": "The team tested tea leaves and bags, finding that cellulose bags performed the best, while cotton and nylon bags barely absorbed any of the metals. However, the scientists noted that nylon bags are already problematic since they release microplastics.",
      "reason": "This paragraph provides specific findings from the study about the effectiveness of different tea bags in absorbing metals.",

      "paragraph": "The researchers also found that finely ground leaves, especially those of black tea, adsorbed more contaminants than whole leaves. All that said, the scientists discovered that the longer they steeped the tea, the better the metal absorption was, no matter the tea or bag type.",

      "paragraph": "According to the Environmental Protection Agency, lead in drinking water can cause a variety of negative health impacts in adults, including decreased kidney function and reproductive problems. Lead is even more impactful in children — low levels in the blood can cause problems such as slowed growth, hearing problems, and anemia, the agency reports. Pregnant women also are at high risk, including via premature births and reduced growth of fetuses.",

According to one study, more than 20% of the U.S. population may rely on groundwater with detectable levels of PFAS, or \"forever chemicals,\" before treatment. Another study in France found disturbing levels of microplastics in both bottle and tap water.",

So little is studied about its capture potential, over and beyond 'release.'\"",
