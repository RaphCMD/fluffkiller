    "CALGARY – Trent Farebrother, the head coach of the women’s national goalball team, says the Paralympic Sport Development Fund was crucial to the success of last month’s national youth training camp in Calgary organized by the Alberta Sports and Recreation Association for the Blind (ASRAB).",
    "‘’Without the fund we wouldn’t have been able to run the event,” he said. ‘’We brought in some people from the national program such as coaches and high performance directors.  It helped a lot. We did individual meetings, education sessions and team building activities in addition to training on the court where we get a baseline of their fitness and offensive and defensive skills.”"
