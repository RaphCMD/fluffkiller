      "paragraph": "Ali is already an essential engine of POLITICO’s news report. Managing breaking news in Brussels, he leads fast-attack coverage of stories from Vladimir Putin’s nuclear threats to the politics of the Olympic games; and from afar he has dipped into the U.S. presidential campaign and even American college sports. Editors across our teams — including in Washington — know he has a gift for balancing the hardest of hard news with subplots from the fun side of politics. And Ali moves with a velocity and precision we should all aspire to emulate.",

This results in awkward asymmetries in our editorial structure: Our European newsroom has 24-hour editing coverage, employing trusted editors in Australia, but cannot assign stories to reporters in North America. Our American newsroom has many more reporters at its disposal, but the website is unstaffed or thinly staffed for hours overnight.",
