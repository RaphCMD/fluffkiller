    "According to the report, the person was at the airport—the world's fourth busiest in terms of passenger numbers—on April 22 and April 23 between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. on both days. It was reported that the person, who was not named, had one prior dose of the MMR vaccine, but they went on to develop a rash on April 25, and tests confirmed they had contracted measles."
