    "An Australian man with heart failure has become the first person in the world to walk out of a hospital with a total artificial heart implant.",
    "The Australian researchers and doctors behind the operation announced on Wednesday that the implant had been an “unmitigated clinical success” after the man lived with the device for more than 100 days before receiving a donor heart transplant in early March."
