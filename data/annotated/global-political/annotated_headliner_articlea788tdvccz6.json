    "What attracted you to work at Bloomberg? How did you know it would be a good fit?",
    "I started my career at a local news publication, but my end goal was always to join a global organization to broaden my skills and network. Bloomberg has many bureaus across the world and is always on top of market-moving news. I really like that the company is driven to be best-in-class in all the products and services it offers. At Bloomberg, there are so many opportunities and resources that support both my short- and long-term ambitions."

      "paragraph": "When I interviewed for the role, I felt really comfortable with my future managers who seemed genuinely interested in my concerns and career goals. There’s less hierarchy here than in other newsrooms, and I can be completely honest with my questions and feedback.

It’s different from my previous job where we worked mostly in silos.",

      "paragraph": "Also, starting a new job can be extremely daunting, especially as a young new hire. In late 2022, I was given the opportunity to join a six-month mentorship program called Reporter Advisory Board, where I worked on several enterprise stories with my assigned mentor in Tokyo. The program was instrumental to my early days at Bloomberg, as the weekly catch-ups with my mentor served as a safe space to discuss story ideas and share my personal struggles. Now, I try to do the same, albeit more informally, with newer colleagues on the team. It’s inspiring to watch their confidence grow over time, just as mine did when I had those sessions with my mentor. I feel it’s important to have a strong peer support system in such a fast-paced work environment.",
