      "paragraph": "\"External data is the next frontier of business impact for financial institutions, yet it is notoriously complex, involving a labyrinth of sources for KYC/AML, identity, fraud, credit checks, and compliance,\" said Mark Hookey, CEO of Demyst, who will remain with Feedzai along with key members of the Demyst team. \"We're thrilled to join Feedzai to bring AI and data together at scale for our customers. Together we are building the most advanced solution for customer onboarding, fraud prevention, and risk management.\"\"An automated and efficient bank account opening process is both the first time a bank gets to know the customer as well as the first line of defense against fraud and financial crime,\" said Dr. Ashish Kakar, Research Financial Insights Director, IDC Asia/Pacific. \"The process has to be seamless to ensure a lasting customer relationship, and at the same time, by building trust from the start, banks not only enhance customer experience, but also strengthen the integrity of the financial system. Feedzai's addition of automated data orchestration to its RiskOps Platform is a powerful combination that will benefit all customers. This should also help the regulators' cause of reducing mule accounts and scams.\"",
