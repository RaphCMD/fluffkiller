    "DONALD TRUMP likes picking fights with judges. In 2016 Mr Trump said a judge’s Mexican heritage rendered him incapable of fairly adjudicating fraud cases against Trump University, a for-profit institution that closed in 2011. Two years later the president condemned a ruling against his immigration policies as a “disgrace”. Lawsuits against him during the Biden years—including one for conspiring to steal the 2020 election—spurred many attacks."
