    "TC Energy Corp. has green-lit a US$900-million pipeline expansion feeding new natural gas-fired power plants in the U.S. Midwest, where artificial intelligence data centres are ravenous for electricity, as well as major refurbishments at the Bruce Power nuclear plant in Ontario.",
    "The Northwoods project would add 400,000 mmBTU’s of capacity to TC’s ANR system, which brings natural gas from Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma to Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois and Ohio. It is expected to come into service in late 2029 and is backed by 20-year contracts."
