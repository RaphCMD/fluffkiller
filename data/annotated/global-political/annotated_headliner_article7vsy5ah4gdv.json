  "context": [
    "Baby-faced batsman Vaibhav Suryavanshi of Rajasthan Royals, all of 14, launched a stunning assault on Indian Premier League title contenders Gujarat Titans’ bowlers this week, marking the arrival of a new superstar in the country’s most popular and commercially viable sport.",
    "As Suryavanshi’s blazing century in just 35 balls sent the packed stadium in Jaipur into a frenzy, talent managers’ phones began buzzing as brand marketers explored early deals. His performance also raises the question whether the youngster from Bihar will follow in the footsteps of several illustrious predecessors in the parallel arena of brand marketing to sell everything from colas to suits. The opinion is sharply divided. While some warn of early burnout and urge caution and patience, others have started to think of tactical deals."
