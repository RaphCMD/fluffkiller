    "These Olympic Games were the first to be planned and delivered in line with the reforms of Olympic Agenda 2020. They were younger, more inclusive, more urban and more sustainable.",
    "They were the very first Olympic Games with full gender parity, because the International Olympic Committee (IOC) allocated 50 per cent of the quota places to female athletes and 50 per cent to male athletes. Olympic and world records were broken, and athletes recorded historic firsts for their countries. On top of this was record breaking engagement, with more than half of the entire world’s population expected* to have followed the Olympic Games Paris 2024. Media Rights-Holders (MRHs) are reporting record figures compared to previous Games, with Paris 2024 anticipated to be the most followed Games ever, with over half of the world’s population expected to have engaged with them."
