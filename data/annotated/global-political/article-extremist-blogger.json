        "An extremist blogger, who has become the Trump administration’s so-called “dark enlightenment” sage, is debating a Harvard professor of political philosophy at an unsanctioned event on its campus next week.",
        "Curtis Yarvin, who was for a time an obscure darling of Silicon Valley and the broader spectrum of the fringe right wing, has emerged as a major philosophical influence on key Capitol Hill power brokers. He is considered a favorite of Vice-President JD Vance, an ally of the tech mogul Peter Thiel, and having the ear of senior state department official, Michael Anton, among others."
