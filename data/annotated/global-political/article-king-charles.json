        "“The King, accompanied by The Queen, will attend The State Opening of the Parliament of Canada, in Ottawa,” Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Friday. Prime Minister Mark Carney called it an “historic honour” that “matches the weight of our times,” during a Friday news conference. The last time a monarch delivered Canada’s throne speech was nearly five decades ago."
