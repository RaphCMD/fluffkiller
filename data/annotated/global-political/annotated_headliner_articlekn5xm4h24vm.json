  "headline": "BREAKING NEWS: Global car carrier K-line fined $23.4 million for criminal cartel offenses - FreightWaves",
  "context": [
    "Ocean automotive carrier Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (K-Line) was convicted of being in a criminal cartel today (August 2, 2019) in Australia. It was fined A$34.5 million (US$23.4 million) by the Federal Court of Australia.",
    "The company would have been given an even bigger fine, A$48 million, but the judge in the Federal Court of Australia showed leniency because of the company’s early guilty plea and assistance. It pleaded guilty last year in the Federal Court of Australia to being involved in a global conspiracy with numerous other ocean shipping companies not to attempt to win business from each other and to fix ocean freight rates for shipping vehicles. It was sentenced today."

It is inimical to and destructive of the competition that underpins Australia’s free market economy. It is ultimately detrimental to, or at least likely to be detrimental to, Australian businesses and consumers. The penalty imposed on K-Line should send a powerful message to multinational corporations that conduct business in Australia that anti-competitive conduct will not be tolerated and will be dealt with harshly. That is so even where, as here, the decisions and conduct are engaged in overseas and as part of a global cartel.”",
