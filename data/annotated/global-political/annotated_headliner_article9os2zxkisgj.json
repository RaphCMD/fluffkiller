  "headline": "Philippines: Former President Duterte’s arrest a monumental step for justice - Amnesty International",
  "context": [
    "Responding to news that former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has been arrested by Philippine authorities on the basis of an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) against him for the crime against humanity of murder in relation to killings in the “war on drugs”, Agnes Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said:",
    "“Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest is a long-awaited and monumental step for justice for the thousands of victims and survivors of his administration’s ‘war on drugs’, which turned much of the Philippines into a nation of mourning. The man who said, ‘my job is to kill’ oversaw the shootings to death of victims – including children – as part of a deliberate, widespread and well-organized campaign of state-sanctioned killings."
