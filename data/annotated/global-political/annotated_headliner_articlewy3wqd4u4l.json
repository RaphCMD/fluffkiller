      "paragraph": "A key source of this natural variability is El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) – a pattern of climate variability in the tropical Pacific – that drives modest year-to-year warming and cooling of the global climate. An El Niño event adds about 0.2°C to the annual global temperature. El Niño affected the temperature values for both 2024 and 2023. La Niña events – which bring cooler conditions – slightly suppressed temperature values in 2021 and 2022 with ENSO conditions being neutral during the last part of 2024. Despite the modest tropical Pacific cooling, the surface temperature of the oceans was record-breaking in 2024.",
