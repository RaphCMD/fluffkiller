    "Their fins — one of the apex predator's distinct features — have long been a coveted commodity in parts of Asia, where shark-fin soup has become a status symbol that can run upwards of $200 for a bowl of the tasteless, gelatinous broth that many believe has medicinal benefits despite an absence of scientific proof."

These activities account for 95 per cent of total shark fishing mortality globally in terms of number of individual sharks caught and killed.
