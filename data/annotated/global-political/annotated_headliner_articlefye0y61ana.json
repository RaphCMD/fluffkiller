      "paragraph": "Dr Gathergood’s dissertation, ‘The Midwifery of God,’ explores the relationship between maternity and divinity. It argues that certain neglected texts conceptualise God in feminine terms, as a heavenly midwife who delivers women through the difficulties of childbearing. The study also reframes traditional accounts of birth as ‘cursed’ by focusing on alternative visions of birthgiving as ‘blessed’.",

My research reframes traditional generic and male-centric construals of salvation by attending to neglected sources which foreground the divine deliverance of the female body and soul. I’m grateful to the Forschungszentrum Internationale und Interdisziplinaere Theologie for their recognition of my work, and to my mentors, colleagues, and student cohort for their support during its development.”",
