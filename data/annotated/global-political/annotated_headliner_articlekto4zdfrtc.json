    "BROSSARD, Que. — Josh Anderson wouldn’t detail what he suffered after New York Rangers forward Arthur Kaliyev fell on his leg in a game at the Bell Centre on Jan. 19. He just said on Friday, after he and his Montreal Canadiens teammates completed exit meetings with management and collected their belongs at their practice facility, that the collision with Kaliyev spawned the first of multiple injuries he fought through before the season ended in Washington on Wednesday.",
    "The 30-year added he had upper- and lower-body ailments and concluded he’d not have been willing to endure them in a losing cause."
