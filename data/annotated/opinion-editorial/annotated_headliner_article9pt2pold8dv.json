  "headline": "Opinion | Tariffs, immigration, and Trump’s First 100 Days: 14 Former Democratic Voters Discuss - The New York Times",
  "context": [
    "To state the obvious, a lot of Democrats loathe President Trump, and a lot of Republicans love him. What about people who used to vote Democratic but decided last November to take a flier on Mr. Trump for the first time? Why did they swing to him? How do they think it’s working out? And what can the Democratic Party do to win them back?",
    "For our latest Times Opinion focus group, we wanted to see Mr. Trump’s first 100 days through the eyes of Americans who — yearning for change, for something to be hopeful about, for someone to fix the economy and immigration — voted for him. We wanted to explore the nature of optimism and regret in politics, what they saw as his successes and failures, why they were drawn to him and what, if anything, has put them off."
