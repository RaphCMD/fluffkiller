      "paragraph": "But remarkably, Mr. Carney offered no whiff of a postelection pause after the mad rush that made him PM, no scaling back his agenda to squeeze it through a minority Parliament, and no tamping down the crisis rhetoric about transforming Canada’s economy while negotiating with the U.S. Full speed ahead.",

      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Wisely, he wasn’t talking about governing like he has a majority. He promised to work across party lines, with provinces and Indigenous people, business and labour. He said he spoke to Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and promised to trigger a quick by-election so he could get a seat in the Commons. “No games,” he said. That’s the right tone for a crisis.",

      "paragraph": "He didn’t answer all the questions, however. He dodged a query about whether his team is trying to lure NDP and Conservative MPs across the floor so his Liberals, having won 168 seats, could government with a majority. Politics goes on, even in crisis.",
