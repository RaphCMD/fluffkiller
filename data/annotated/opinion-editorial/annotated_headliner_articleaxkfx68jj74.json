    "President Trump is pressing CEOs to announce new U.S. investments, but has he spoken with his friend Sean O’Brien, the Teamsters boss? United Parcel Service on Tuesday announced 20,000 job cuts and 73 facility closures this year in no small part thanks to Mr. O’Brien.",
    "The UPS layoffs follow its January decision to cut half of its delivery business with Amazon, its largest customer. The shipper’s rising labor costs have made many Amazon deliveries less lucrative. Amazon can use its own network of mostly non-union drivers to deliver more of its own packages at lower cost than UPS."

      "paragraph": "Last year UPS announced 12,000 job cuts, mostly in management, owing to falling package volumes and rising labor costs from its 2023 Teamsters agreement. That contract raised average compensation for full-time drivers to $170,000 from $145,000 over five years. Teamsters at UPS get up to seven weeks of vacation and don’t pay healthcare premiums.",

Mr. O’Brien on Tuesday said UPS “is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs under our current national master agreement.” He’s misleading his members.",
