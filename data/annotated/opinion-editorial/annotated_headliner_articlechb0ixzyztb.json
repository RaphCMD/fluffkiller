    "Volunteers with Citizens Not Politicians, the citizens' effort last year to reform Ohio's redistricting system, load boxes of signed petitions to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose's office on Monday, July 1, 2024, in Columbus, Ohio. A new legislative proposal would add new requirements that petition circulators would have to meet, including wearing \"paid\" badges if they receive anything of value for their efforts.

      "paragraph": "Tucked into a 204-plus-page bill pending in Columbus is further evidence that Ohio voters are rattling Statehouse insiders by resorting to statewide ballot issues – which is Ohioans’ constitutional right – to block or overthrow radical legislation.",

      "paragraph": "Senate Bill 153 is sponsored by Republican state Sens. Theresa Gavarone, of Bowling Green, and Andrew Brenner, of Delaware. As cleveland.com’s Anna Staver reported, “Voting rights groups say the [bill’s proposed] changes will make it harder to bring issues before voters” and “called it a reaction to Ohioans legalizing marijuana and putting abortion protections in the state constitution in 2023.”",

      "paragraph": "But in 2004, the Ohio General Assembly enacted a law requiring statewide issue campaigns to report “all money or things” of value paid to petition circulators, as well as such circulators’ names and addresses. Anyone is free to obtain that information from the Ohio secretary of state’s office and to publicize it.",

    {
      "paragraph": "That’s why the Gavarone-Brenner bill is pile-it-on overkill by Statehouse insiders fearful of Ohio voters. It implies that someone paid to circulate a petition is merely seeking money rather than being committed to the candidate or cause the petition supports. But the real issue isn’t a circulator’s motivations but whether broad access to the ability to petition for ballot access helps advance Ohio voters’ option to legislate for themselves. It does. And that’s what scares entrenched Statehouse partisans.",

At that same 2023 election, voters, also 57% to 43%, approved a voter-petitioned law (not a constitutional amendment) to let people age 21 or older possess and use marijuana in Ohio. The General Assembly had long delayed action on recreational marijuana legalization, virtually forcing its backers to go to the statewide ballot. But because the initiative wrote a law, not a constitutional amendment, the General Assembly is free to weaken legalization and has been busily trying to do so.",

But badges could impede proposed statewide ballot-issue campaigns, in which issue backers must gather huge numbers of signatures (for example, at least 413,487 statewide to propose a constitutional amendment, with those signatures obtained in at least 44 of the 88 counties.)
