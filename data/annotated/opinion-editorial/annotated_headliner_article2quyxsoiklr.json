    "The novelist Ian McEwan tells a good story about the opening party for Tate Modern on 11 May 2000, when he was introduced to the then prime minister, Tony Blair, by the Tate director, Nicholas Serota. Mr Blair shook the author’s hand and told him that he was a big fan of his work and had some of his paintings in Downing Street.",
    "Yoko Ono, Jarvis Cocker and Neil Tennant were also there, along with Queen Elizabeth II. As the gallery celebrates its 25th anniversary, it is hard to imagine such an extravaganza happening today."

      "paragraph": "Back then, London was the only major European city not to boast a world-class gallery of modern art. This repurposed power station was set to become the UK’s cultural powerhouse. Hulking on a once unloved stretch of the South Bank, its 99-metre tower signalled a message of regeneration and possibility to the rest of the world. And the world responded. They had prepared for 2 million visitors in its first year – 5 million came.",

      "paragraph": "Following Cool Britannia and the Young British Artists in the 90s, Tate Modern blasted away the last vestiges of British stuffiness about contemporary art. To disguise the gaps in the collection, Mr Serota replaced chronological hanging with a thematic one (to much critical dismay). Instead of imitating competitors like the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Tate Modern rewrote the rules and set the tone for 21st-century museums.",

But its greatest triumph is undoubtedly the 300 sq metre Turbine Hall. The cavernous space has encouraged artists to expand their imaginations to fit. Louise Bourgeois’s giant spider, Maman, which first greeted visitors, returns for the anniversary celebrations.",
