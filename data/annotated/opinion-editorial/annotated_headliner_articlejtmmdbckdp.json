    "Here’s a quaint idea: If the government is going to punish someone, it should be for something the person has done, not the viewpoint he or she holds while doing it.",
    "Antidiscrimination laws have made that distinction harder and harder to maintain. The Antisemitism Awareness Act would continue the trend. The AAA passed the House 320-91 last year, but on Wednesday it stumbled in a Senate committee as Democratic lawmakers and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) raised free-speech concerns. The pause is welcome because the legislation is flawed. But the real lesson is broader: America’s civil rights model for managing diversity warps public debate and needs to be reconsidered."

      "paragraph": "The AAA would broaden the definition of antisemitism, essentially by defining anti-Zionism as antisemitic for the purposes of civil rights law. The legislation incorporates examples of antisemitism, including “applying a double standard” to Israel.",
      "reason": "This paragraph provides specific details about how the AAA would change the definition of antisemitism.",

    {
      "paragraph": "Applying a double standard to Israel or any other country is protected by the First Amendment, of course. But in civil rights law, the line between politically charged speech and harassment of an identity group is blurry. Persistent anti-Israel advocacy on college campuses could be classified as discrimination against Jewish students. So, if the AAA passed, colleges would have a greater incentive to tamp down anti-Israel activities to avoid civil rights investigations.",
      "reason": "This paragraph explains the potential implications of the AAA on college campuses, contributing to the main argument.",

    {
      "paragraph": "Think about it this way: Suppose college students occupied a campus building to call for wealth redistribution, as sometimes happened during the Occupy Wall Street movement of the early 2010s. That might break campus rules or local laws, but it’s none of the federal government’s business. But suppose students instead occupied a campus building to condemn the state of Israel. That could be an antisemitic act under the AAA and therefore evidence that the college is violating civil rights. The real offense, as far as the federal government is concerned, is not conduct but the viewpoint behind it. The AAA would expand the scope of viewpoints that could trigger federal scrutiny.",

      "paragraph": "Blurring the distinction between viewpoints and actions gets the government deeper into the business of trying to control thought. Perhaps that is necessary to suppress discrimination against Jews. But Leo Strauss, one of the foremost Jewish intellectuals of the 20th century, warned about where this logic could lead: “The prohibition against every ‘discrimination’ would mean the abolition of the private sphere, the denial of the difference between the state and society, in a word, the destruction of liberal society,” he said during a 1962 speech. “We have empirical data,” he noted drily, about the effect of “the abolition of liberal society” on “the fate of the Jews.”",

      "paragraph": "Strauss was a conservative. Until recently, many liberals would have scoffed at the idea that civil rights enforcement was in tension with “liberal society.” But the Trump administration’s assault on Harvard and other universities could jolt liberal thinking. The administration cited antisemitism and civil rights laws in demanding far-reaching changes to Harvard’s governance last month. When the university balked, the administration began to withhold research funding, and Harvard filed a lawsuit defending its constitutional right to run its own affairs.",

      "paragraph": "The Ivy League has been in populist-conservative crosshairs for years, of course. But the outbreak of (sometimes vicious) anti-Israel activism on college campuses since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack has given the right an ideal opening to go on offense. Trump is trying to turn the civil rights model pioneered and expanded by liberals against liberalism’s own power centers. He might not be successful — the Harvard defunding appears legally ham-fisted — but Strauss’s warning about state control of the private sphere under the guise of antidiscrimination ought to look more prescient to liberals now.",

      "paragraph": "At the very least, fixating on nondiscrimination flattens public debate. Jacob M. Miller, a senior at Harvard University who was president of the campus Hillel in 2023, observes the tediousness of parsing whether anti-Israel activism at Harvard is antisemitic. “This excessive focus on semantics is symptomatic of a larger problem with our politics,” he writes in the student newspaper. “We reflexively condemn reprehensible ideologies only insofar as they are racist or hateful — rather than because they’re plain wrong.”",

      "label": 1

    {
      "paragraph": "Miller adds that this “has created a twisted incentive structure — one in which Jews on campus feel compelled to characterize certain behaviors as antisemitic because they know that is the one sin campus will surely condemn.” After all, if a viewpoint can be labeled discriminatory, the door is open to government discipline. That tends to reduce debates with historical, religious and foreign policy dimensions into contests about whether one racial or ethnic or sexual group or another is victimized. Deeper questions lose significance, and political deliberation is impoverished.",

The Antisemitism Awareness Act is just a footnote in that project. But the resistance it faced in the Senate should highlight the more fundamental danger of even indirect government efforts to supervise thought in a polarized society.",

      "paragraph": "That problem extends beyond antidiscrimination statutes. As legal scholar Robert Leider has noted, federal criminal law, at least in politically charged cases, “is increasingly turning to policing motive, where the same act may be criminal or lawful depending on the motivation of the actor.” It’s a tendency that must be not only resisted but also reversed to conserve political freedom.",
