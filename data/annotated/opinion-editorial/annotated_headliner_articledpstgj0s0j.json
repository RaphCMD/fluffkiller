    {
      "paragraph": "We’re used to partisan disagreement about cabinet officials. Democrats are never going to be that impressed by a Republican cabinet (and vice versa), but as with so many things, the perception gap between Republicans and Democrats has become so vast, it’s as if they inhabit different universes.",
      "reason": "This provides context about the partisan divide relevant to the perception of Trump's cabinet.",

      "paragraph": "Trump’s critics — and I am one — look at the lineup and see, in essence, a group of people that bears far more resemblance to a collection of North Korean generals than it does to a traditional American cabinet.",

    {
      "paragraph": "Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said in one cabinet meeting that Trump was “overwhelmingly elected by the biggest majority.” Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, said, “What you have assembled in your vision is a turning point and an inflection point in American history.” Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, said, “What you’re doing now I think is a great service to our country but ultimately to the world.”",

    {
      "paragraph": "Rubio is among the worst offenders. Before Trump’s rise, he developed a reputation as an independent strategic thinker, committed to America’s global leadership. And now he’s the caretaker of a shrinking State Department who has turned into Trump’s willing accomplice as Trump undermines American credibility and destroys American alliances.",

      "paragraph": "First, let’s talk about strength and courage. MAGA mythology requires both of those virtues to support Trump. His supporters see virtually every significant American institution opposed to his rise. The mainstream media, the universities, Hollywood: They’re all united in opposition to Trump.",

      "label": 1

    {
      "paragraph": "As a consequence, supporting Trump is an act of defiance in and of itself. This is one reason you see Trump supporters wearing clothing that says things like “Lions, not sheep.” Trump is a lion, and his supporters are lions for standing beside him.",

      "paragraph": "When you add Trump’s legal woes to the mix, the acts of alleged courage only grow more profound. After all, to belong to Trump’s team is to risk prosecution — the “weaponization” (as he and his law enforcement officers like to put it) of American justice.",

      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Add that perception to the genuine relief that he survived two assassination attempts, and you can see that Trump’s supporters don’t view gratitude as just acceptable. It’s mandatory. He’s the man who was impeached for them, prosecuted for them, and shot at for them.",

      "paragraph": "In this context, Trump’s cabinet isn’t judged as much by its results as by its ability to trigger or enrage Trump’s opponents. If the media is angry, Trump’s base is happy. That means they’ll cheer absurd pictures of the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, cosplaying as an immigration enforcement agent, holding a rifle and wearing a tactical vest, simply because it makes Trump’s opponents angry, because it upsets their vision of responsible, sober leadership.",

      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Trump is a singular figure. No one else in the Republican Party comes close to matching his influence and authority. In fact, I’ve never seen an American politician at any time match his influence and authority over the Republican base.",

      "paragraph": "There is also overwhelming evidence that he’s not an economic or military genius, but instead often flies by the seat of his pants. The on-again, off-again tariff regime is an ideal example. He loves tariffs, but he fears the consequences of his own policy, so we lurch wildly from statement to statement, depending on the fluctuations of the market.",
