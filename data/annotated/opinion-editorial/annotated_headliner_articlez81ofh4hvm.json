    {
      "paragraph": "Fast: The president and his administration keep changing their plans on tariffs, seemingly by the hour — a policy whiplash that has caused chaos in the financial markets.",
      "reason": "This paragraph provides relevant information about the rapid changes in tariff plans and their impact on financial markets.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Slow: The giant container ships that carry most international trade take about a month to cross the Pacific. That means many of the goods loaded onto ships in China the day before April 2, or what Trump has called “Liberation Day,” have not reached U.S. shores. It also means the effect of canceled sailings post-“Liberation Day” have hardly been felt.",
      "reason": "This paragraph provides relevant context about the delay in the impact of tariffs due to shipping times.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Even slower: Different businesses hold different amounts of inventory in the United States that allow them to bridge gaps in supply. Many businesses invested in greater inventory capacity in the aftermath of covid, and they stocked up pre-tariffs. So even after those goods don’t arrive, they will still be able to operate as normal — for a little while.",
      "reason": "This paragraph provides relevant information about how businesses are managing inventory to mitigate tariff impacts.",

      "paragraph": "Follow Trump’s second term",
      "reason": "This is a non-informative prompt unrelated to the article's main premise.",

    },
    {
      "paragraph": "The upshot of all this is that as big as the fight over Trump’s tariffs has been, Americans have yet to face the worst consequences of government messing so aggressively with trade. That’s because the pain is not moving at the speed of the stock market, news cycle or Trump’s social-media habit. It’s moving at the speed of those ships — and if it eventually gets here, it won’t be pretty.",
      "reason": "This paragraph summarizes the main argument about the delayed impact of tariffs, directly related to the headline.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "It’s still not certain that it will, which in a way is part of the problem. Because of those lag times between tariffs’ imposition and their economic effects, many of the largest businesses are likely still calculating that they can wait the policy out.",
      "reason": "This paragraph provides context on the lag time between tariff imposition and economic effects, relevant to the headline.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "It’s notable, for instance, that so far the plaintiffs in lawsuits over the tariffs — imposed without Congress, under the auspices of a nonexistent national emergency, by the authority of a law that has never before been used to impose tariffs — have so far been small companies and state governments, not large companies.",
      "reason": "This paragraph provides specific information about who is challenging the tariffs, relevant to the headline.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Large companies, after all, have much larger volumes of trade, and much larger budgets to hire the best lawyers. So why aren’t they rushing into court? It’s likely because they still think the problem will go away on its own, maybe with a little help from lobbyists. It should surprise no one that spending on trade lobbying, vital to securing exemptions for favored firms, is 277 percent higher in the first quarter of this year than it was in the first quarter of last year.",
      "reason": "This paragraph explains why large companies are not challenging the tariffs, relevant to the headline.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Those firms understand that signals from the bond market and public opinion are more likely to influence broader political calculations by the administration. And these have been unambiguous. Bond yields are up and the dollar is down, which means investors are less confident in the United States. Trump’s approval ratings — especially on economic issues but with signs of leakage into other issues such as immigration — are falling. If you’re a big company with warehouses full of stuff, maybe you won’t have to face the consequences of sticking your neck out.",
      "reason": "This paragraph provides context on economic indicators and public opinion affecting the administration's decisions, relevant to the headline.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "But this is a double-edged sword. To the administration’s chagrin, that also means big companies aren’t going to be making major investment decisions if they believe the tariffs won’t be around in their current form by the end of the year, let alone the end of the decade. A week is an eternity in politics, especially Trump-era politics, but it’s not that long for big businesses. They’ve seen politicians abandon silly plans before.",
      "reason": "This paragraph discusses the impact of tariffs on investment decisions by big companies, relevant to the headline.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "A president who moved more like a container ship might have synced up the politics and policy. If the administration really wanted to change production patterns, it would have worked to make credible long-term commitments to a stable trade policy. It hasn’t done that at all. In the meantime, businesses twiddle their thumbs, forgoing major investments and waiting for reality to dawn.",
      "reason": "This paragraph discusses the lack of long-term trade policy commitments and its impact on businesses, directly relating to the headline about tariff pain.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "The lag created by the speed of ocean transit and inventories means that Americans have hardly begun to feel the pain tariffs will cause. Much of the value wiped off the stock market can come back if the administration cans its tariff plan. Most business decisions about suppliers and investment haven’t been jerked around, only put on ice.",
      "reason": "This paragraph explains the delayed impact of tariffs and potential recovery, directly contributing to the main premise of tariff pain.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "As long as Trump’s tariff policy remains in place, the U.S. is not going to experience a uniform transition from foreign to domestic production, as the administration desires. Instead, Americans will suffer sporadic shortages and price hikes as each business adjusts at its own pace. And those boatloads of pain are slowly approaching somewhere out there on the Pacific Ocean.",
      "reason": "This paragraph describes the consequences of the tariff policy, aligning with the article's focus on the impending tariff pain.",
