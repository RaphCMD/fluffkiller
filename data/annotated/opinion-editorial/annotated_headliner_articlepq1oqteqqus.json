He called us to God’s expectation that we recognize the humble divinity within each of us and treat one another with respect. Have feeding and caring for the poor become unworthy goals?

Schools endeavor to teach students proper ways to use both print and electronic resources such as ChatGPT in their writing and how to cite those resources when they do. One facet of that process that most students do not appear to struggle with is knowing that they must credit the poet when copying an entire poem word for word. The editor of the Free for All page seems to have missed that lesson in school. On April 19, the caption for the beautiful picture of the Chicago skyline was one of my favorite short poems, “Fog” by Carl Sandburg, included in its 21-word entirety with no credit given to Sandburg. Please give artists credit for their work and refrain from leading students to believe it is permissible to steal another’s work and present it as one’s own.",
