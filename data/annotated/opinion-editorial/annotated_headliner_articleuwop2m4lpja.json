  "context": [
    "BERLIN — The sturdiest pillars of Germany’s domestic and international identity have been pulverized with such dizzying speed over the past few weeks that millions of Germans must wake up these days wondering: Wait, what just happened?",
    "The man now charged with making sense of that seismic disruption, and providing a stabilizing road map for Germany’s new place in the world, is Friedrich Merz, a 69-year-old former corporate lawyer. Merz — untested, maladroit and personally unpopular — eked out a victory in Germany’s splintered elections in February and will formally become chancellor on May 6."

      "paragraph": "Even before last year’s U.S. presidential election, the quickening pace of disruption had upended German politics and contributed to prolonged stagnation of Germany’s economy, the world’s third-largest. Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine halted Germany’s supply of cheap Russian energy; China, a booming market for German exports, was rapidly becoming a rival.",

    {
      "paragraph": "One shock was the Trump administration’s open hostility, broadcast by Vice President JD Vance, in his speech at the Munich Security Conference, and by Elon Musk, in venomous social media posts. Another was Trump’s own contempt for the transatlantic partnership and pro-Putin tilt.",

      "paragraph": "Give Merz credit for correctly assessing the scale of the transformation and responding in equal measure. Within hours of his victory in Germany’s Feb. 23 elections, he announced on live television that henceforth his “absolute priority” would be to “achieve independence from the U.S.,” which he said had become “largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.”",

      "paragraph": "Pushing the measure through Germany’s lame-duck parliament, Merz opened the way for nearly $1 trillion in new spending over the next decade, the country’s biggest fiscal shot in the arm since the Berlin Wall fell. That amount could supercharge defense industrial production beyond Germany’s borders, partly offsetting the coming U.S. military drawdown across Europe.",

No other major Western economy is as export-dependent as Germany’s, which sells more than $180 billion in goods annually to the U.S., the most in the European Union. That makes Berlin exceptionally vulnerable to Trump’s announced and threatened tariffs, including on automobiles and pharmaceuticals.",

      "paragraph": "The other immediate danger is domestic. Merz and his party, which scored under 30 percent in the elections, have slipped even further in the polls amid jockeying over government policies between the coalition partners. That forced marriage soured many in Merz’s own base, who thought he’d given away too much in the deal. As he enters office, barely 1 in 5 Germans regard him as trustworthy.",
