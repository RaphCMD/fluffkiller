  "headline": "Sheriff Swank undercuts his own message on 911 calls | Tacoma News Tribune",
  "context": [
    "It’s a laudable goal to reassure Pierce County residents that they can call the police without fear of deportation. That’s what Sheriff Keith Swank tried to do when he told The News Tribune this week that his department doesn’t run the information of crime victims to see if they have legal status.",
    "It’s essential that anyone who needs to call 911, especially for their own safety or the safety of others, should be able to do that without hesitation or fear. (And it should be said that 911 doesn’t lead directly to the Sheriff’s Office. It’s a dispatch service that’s connected with first responders throughout the region.)"

      "paragraph": "But the sheriff’s policy isn’t the only thing that matters when it comes to making people feel confident when calling law enforcement. Perceptions are important, too. So it’s odd that Swank would make his comments the same month he traveled to Washington, D.C., where he briefly met with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.",

      "paragraph": "Swank wants to focus on criminals, and that’s good. But to make residents comfortable calling the Sheriff’s Office, what Swank really needs to do is publicly say he supports due process for undocumented immigrants. As of now, he’s aligned himself with an immigration policy that says the opposite.",

That’s the agenda that, in just 100 days, has racked up court challenges, raised constitutional questions and unleashed chaos on the lives of immigrants and visitors. It’s an agenda that argues that non-citizens aren’t owed due process in the United States.",

He was traveling with a group of Washington sheriffs to show support for Adams County Sheriff Dale Wagner, who is fighting for the ability to assist federal officials with immigration enforcement. Wagner is facing a lawsuit from Washington Attorney General Nick Brown for allegedly holding people in custody based solely on their immigration status and aiding immigration enforcement officials in other ways that violate state law.",

      "paragraph": "In the Tacoma region, University of Washington international students saw their legal status terminated with no notification and little explanation. In one case, immigration officials based the termination on an unproven allegation of a non-violent crime, when federal law requires a conviction of a crime of violence in order to strip a student’s legal status. The government gave back legal status to many students, but not before turning their lives and education upside down.",
