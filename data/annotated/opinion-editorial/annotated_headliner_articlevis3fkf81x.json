    "President Trump has effectively suspended the law Congress passed last spring banning TikTok. Credit to GOP Attorneys General from Tennessee, Alabama and Montana for trying to enforce it.",
    "Attorneys General Jonathan Skrmetti (Tenn.), Austin Knudsen (Mont.) and Steve Marshall (Ala.) on Thursday evening subpoenaed Apple and Google for documents related to their compliance with the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. That law required TikTok to divest from its Chinese owner ByteDance by Jan. 19 or be banned."

      "paragraph": "It’s unclear if ByteDance and Chinese President Xi Jinping would agree to a total divestment that complies with the law since Beijing deems TikTok’s algorithms a state secret. Mr. Trump’s 145% tariffs on China have also complicated negotiations. The President has extended his reprieve for another 75 days.",
