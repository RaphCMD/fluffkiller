Any attempts to hang on would have been a farce. It is time for a new leader and, frankly, it might have been time before the last election. The party only won seven seats Monday, although the results remain unofficial. It needed 12 to maintain official party status, with the money and resources that come with it. That hurts.",

While the final, authorized tally is still some time away, it’s clear the Liberals are in a minority position and the party may well need to turn to the New Democrats for support. This, in turn, could be an opportunity for the NDP to push for expanded pharmacare and dental care programs, or green-energy initiatives. There should be some gains for which they can take credit.",

For instance, the party received little to no tangible benefit for the role it played in the pharmacare and dental care initiatives brought in under Justin Trudeau as part of the two parties’ supply-and-confidence agreement, signed in 2022. If anything, the NDP might have been penalized for propping up a government, and a prime minister, detested by the broader electorate.",

The hard truth is the New Democrats have been on a steady decline since Mr. Layton led them to 103 seats, with more than 30 per cent of the popular vote and 4.5 million ballots cast for them in 2011.
