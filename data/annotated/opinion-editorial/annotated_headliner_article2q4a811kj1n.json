      "paragraph": "The conservative journalist Andrew Breitbart observed that politics is downstream from culture — that voters are more influenced by what they watch, listen to and like than by politicians. As a Democrat who works on presidential campaigns, I think Mr. Breitbart was spot-on, and I’d torture the metaphor further: Democrats today are rowing upstream against powerful new cultural currents, while Republicans are working relentlessly to dam the river itself. The G.O.P. is focused on achieving long-term cultural change. We’re focused on short-term political gain.",

      "paragraph": "Today’s culture is no longer a creation of executives in New York City and Los Angeles. Thanks to algorithms and an endless set of media choices, what you see, read and hear is a personalized reflection of your own interests. It’s like a city with a lot of different neighborhoods. You might live in the personal fitness neighborhood or the parenting neighborhood, and you’ll never cross over into the equine science neighborhood or, say, the politics neighborhood. So if you don’t care about politics — or more precisely, don’t trust our politics — you don’t have to hear about it at all. A voter can turn on, tune in or opt out.",

      "paragraph": "But opting out of politics doesn’t mean never hearing about it. Opt-out voters aren’t watching CNN or paying for news subscriptions, but they still get a lot of information from social media, friends and family. Politics, for them, tends to show up as cultural drift — bits of stories, values and secondhand outrage shared online by friends, influencers and nonpolitical creators. It’s ambient, not deliberate. It’s culture, not news. A young dad scrolling Instagram for parenting tips stumbles across a clip about traditional family values. A small-business owner watching finance videos gets fed posts about why woke policies are destroying the economy. A 25-year-old gym enthusiast on TikTok starts seeing content about masculinity, personal responsibility and — soon enough — right-wing politics.",

People who are most likely well educated and well off, perhaps for whom inflation is less of a concern. People who show up for obscure, off-year elections in swing states.

I’ve come up through a party that clings to TV ads and news releases, holding on to a media environment that stopped existing a decade ago. A party that thought Barack Obama’s cultural cool would last forever and that young voters were table stakes. A party fundamentally mismatched with the task at hand. While we prattle on, concerning ourselves with those who already agree with us, the right has built an information machine aimed squarely at opt-out voters — people sick of traditional politics.",

Opt-in voters are more likely to trust mainstream institutions, after all. This leaves us relying on a news media industry that neither is a partisan ally nor reaches the voters we need. Our online ecosystem can’t sustainably thrive. So we’re stuck: We’ve got opt-in media for an opt-out electorate. At a time when many Americans don’t trust the mainstream press or Hollywood, the left owns where voters used to be. The right owns where voters are going. It leaves Democrats unable to influence the culture that really matters today, which leaves us unable to make our case to the voters we need.",

It won’t be profitable until the audience moves there, and that audience won’t move until it’s got somewhere to go. The campaign donors who now flow money to TV ads and an army of press secretaries need to invest in getting this started, and they will need capital to keep it going. There are plenty of smart creators in this swimming pool already, but they need resources to create, experiment and grow.",

In this Trump era, in which working people foot the bill for Elon Musk and Mr. Trump’s self-dealing while the government gets further into people’s bedrooms, we have a chance to offer something different. Not a return to normal but a vision for a better future. A government that roots out corruption, checks runaway corporate power and works — for the love of God, works. A country where you don’t go broke when you get sick, where you’ll be left alone if you’re not hurting anyone. We should help people believe in better.

It’s a coalition that acknowledges that campaigning through culture is as much about style as it is substance. Mr. Sanders holds big rallies, but he also goes viral at Coachella. It is perhaps the case that leaders who don’t live in this media environment can’t possibly understand it, but it’s no excuse for denying what’s in front of us. One of the deeper political challenges with President Joe Biden’s age was not the number; it was the fact that voters believed his age meant he couldn’t understand them. We are now seeing a generation of 70-year-olds who called for the departure of an 81-year-old fail to understand how anyone under 60 gets information about the world.",
