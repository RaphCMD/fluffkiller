    {
      "paragraph": "If the character were real, he’d probably crack his whip at the Hudson’s Bay Company for trying to sell its royal charter. This piece of Canadian history dates to 1670 and granted the company quasi-governmental rights over all the territory whose waters flowed into Hudson Bay.",

      "paragraph": "U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to Canada’s economy and sovereignty have reminded many Canadians that they live in a great country, and have a history worth fighting for. The HBC charter is a vital part of the history of the country that they’re rising up to defend. It must not be allowed to leave Canada.",

      "paragraph": "To underscore the absurdity of the current situation, consider that four original copies of the Magna Carta, a first step toward reining in English royal power, are available for public viewing in the United Kingdom. A permanent exhibition in Washington displays both the Declaration of Independence and the Emancipation Proclamation, which extended the ideals of the revolution to enslaved people and set the country on a course toward racial equality.",

      "paragraph": "The company was a physical presence in a vast land that worked to deter competing national claims. Their reliance on Indigenous traders interwove the fortunes of settlers and First Nations across much of the country. These ties were later replaced with the treaties that still underpin the country’s complicated relationship with Indigenous peoples.",

      "paragraph": "The British aristocrats running the company were colonial exploiters who claimed control of land inhabited by Indigenous nations, based on the racist argument that it was empty of “civilized people.” Christian missionaries followed trading routes in search of converts, leading eventually to the residential schools that are a blot on Canada’s soul.",
