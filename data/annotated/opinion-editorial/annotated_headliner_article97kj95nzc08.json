      "paragraph": "State Sen. Ram Villivalam, D-Chicago, wants to adopt a state payroll tax to do something that sounds good — cover paid family and medical leave. Called the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program Act, Villivalam’s legislation would impose a new tax based on a worker’s wages and would be withheld automatically from paychecks, just like Social Security and Medicare. Both the employee and the employer would have to contribute toward this payroll tax.",

      "paragraph": "Revenue from the program, which would impose a 1.12% tax on paychecks (paid in part by the employee and in part by the employer), would fund benefits in a state-managed paid leave program, giving workers up to 18 weeks of paid family/medical leave each year, plus up to nine extra weeks for pregnancy. The tax would take effect Jan. 1, 2027, for employers with 25 or more workers.",

      "paragraph": "Sounds good, right? Unfortunately, as with all new taxes, this one is all but sure to rise with time. Consider Minnesota, which is launching its own leave program and payroll tax. In 2023, legislators enacted a 0.7% payroll tax to take effect in 2026. The tax hasn’t even hit employers yet, but lawmakers already have boosted the rate to 0.88% since then.",

      "paragraph": "If times were better in Illinois, a proposal like this might be worth considering, given the struggles new parents face. It’s especially egregious that many women, lacking federal paid leave or job protection, are forced to return to work just a few weeks after giving birth — or risk losing their jobs. But times aren’t good, not for the state’s economy or its finances — which continue to be plagued by $144 billion in pension debt and yearly budget deficits.",

      "paragraph": "A state payroll tax would punish businesses for … hiring people, something we desperately need them to do. While intended to help workers afford time off for health and family reasons, it would increase the cost of hiring and maintaining jobs here and expose both employers and employees to future tax hikes if the program runs deficits.",
