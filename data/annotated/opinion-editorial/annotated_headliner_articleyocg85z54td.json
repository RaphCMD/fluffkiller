  "headline": "Opinion | When government becomes a religion, justice is replaced by control",
  "context": [
    "There’s a quiet transformation underway in Alabama: lawmakers are turning government into a kind of religion. Not one rooted in grace, humility or justice — but in control, fear and exclusion. Not the faith of Jesus — but the rigidity of the scribes and Pharisees He condemned.",
    "Instead of caring for the people, they are commanding them. Instead of lifting burdens, they are legislating them."

      "paragraph": "The Legislature mandates the Ten Commandments in classrooms, yet refuses to fund the schools that house them. It criminalizes drag shows, censors libraries, and silences honest discussions of identity and history. Most recently, it passed SB1, a law that makes it a crime to help someone obtain or deliver an absentee ballot. It’s a direct attack on the elderly, the disabled, rural voters and faith-based groups who see civic participation as part of their ministry. That’s not governance — it’s suppression.",

      "paragraph": "What we are seeing is not faith in action—it is control disguised as conviction. A government that rewards allegiance and punishes dissent. That praises God with its lips but hardens its heart to the poor, the sick and the different. If this is what passes for Christian government, then it’s a gospel rewritten by power — not by Christ.",
