In the case of the New Democrats’ near-obliteration, the obvious conclusion is that there was a strong movement away from the NDP toward the other two main parties (I guess the only two main parties at the moment) because voters had strong opinions about who they wanted to lead the country through the Trumpocalypse: either the brainy economist, who many saw as the grown-up in the room; or the well-seasoned, scrappy politician, who can brawl with the best of them, and represented true change.",

Mr. Poilievre could tack “for a change” onto as many sentences as he liked, but Canadians have been hearing him gripe for years now. Mr. Carney was a fresh face. And while change seemed desirable, in the midst of so much uncertainty, voters may have felt more comfortable with a safer kind of shift.
