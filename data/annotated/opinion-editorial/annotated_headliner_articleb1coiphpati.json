The housing shortage has left a generation of young Canadians wondering if they will be able to afford a home of their own. Any one of those problems would be enough to dominate the agenda of the next government. Together, they add up to a turning point in Canada’s history. The country is at a crossroads, and voters must pick a path: the Liberals, with a promise that, this time, high spending and an interventionist Ottawa will steady the economy.
