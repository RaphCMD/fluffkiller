  "context": [
    "In the first 100 days of the second Trump administration, we've witnessed unprecedented attacks on our rights, targeting vulnerable communities and undermining our democracy. In that time, the amount of overreach from the executive branch has been staggering. President Donald Trump has issued orders and actions that attempt to end birthright citizenship, end asylum, end climate protections, discriminate against transgender people, end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, expedite deportations without due process, undermine free speech rights for all, defund organizations or institutions that don't align with his administration, deport international students for their beliefs, and target law firms, lawyers, and judges for upholding the rule of law.",
    "This list is only part of the larger onslaught of executive actions that are attempting to remove fundamental pillars of our free and democratic society."

      "paragraph": "Right now, these very rights, our values, and our communities are under attack by the current administration. In his effort to systematically eviscerate checks and balances on his own power, President Trump has taken aim at the legal system, including lawyers and the judiciary. He's issued more than a half dozen directives targeting law firms and individual lawyers because they have represented clients he opposes, brought litigation he dislikes, or taken positions he sees as adversarial. He's targeting those who are filing lawsuits that attempt to hold him accountable for his unconstitutional actions. He's criticized judges that have ruled against him, calling them \"radical left lunatics.\" And just days ago, the FBI arrested Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan in a blatant effort to chill and intimidate.",

Our work to uphold the rule of law is about more than defending colleagues in an industry we share; it's about recognizing that once the president targets one firm, organization, or judge, he can—and will—target all. And once the precedent is set, future presidents can continue to abuse the office to demand loyalty from law firms and other institutions.",

      "paragraph": "Core constitutional principles are at grave risk because of President Trump's actions. The First Amendment protects lawyers' advocacy on behalf of clients, and it prohibits the government from punishing advocacy with which it disagrees. In our adversarial legal system, due process and separation of powers require that judges rely on lawyers willing to challenge the government to assess whether there have been constitutional violations. By targeting those who disagree with him, the president is intending to chill advocacy against his positions, hoping to silence opposition through fear.",

And the true strength of our rights is determined by how willing all of us are to safeguard them, especially in times of turmoil. Allowing the president to dictate what lawsuits are filed or what clients are represented undermines the rule of law and threatens the independence of our judiciary.
