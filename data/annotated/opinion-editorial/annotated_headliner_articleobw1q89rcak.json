    "Like many conservatives, I have spent my life as an advocate of unforced societal evolution rather than radical change. Yet in recent years I’ve found myself in unexpected territory.

      "paragraph": "What happens, though, when daily life has already been warped? Over the past decade, our communities were wrenched by government and cultural manias more controlling, crusading and coercive than anything ever seen in the U.S. The Great Awokening. The Covid lies and lockdowns. The hypocritical exemptions to the pandemic mandates granted for the Black Lives Matter riots. Disturbing new racial and sexual ideologies. Vast expansions of federal spending and power. Political weaponization of the justice system.",
