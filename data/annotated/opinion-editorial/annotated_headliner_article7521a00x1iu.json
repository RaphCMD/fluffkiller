      "paragraph": "For years, we’ve competed against low-cost imports from countries like China, where labor is cheap not because of efficiency, but because of low wages and minimal benefits. In Utah, we do things differently. We invest in our people, offering good wages, full benefits and real opportunities for growth. That commitment builds stronger communities — but it comes at a cost and is hard to sustain when the market expects luxury craftsmanship at rock-bottom prices.",

      "paragraph": "Yes, tariffs may raise prices in the short term. But they also encourage smarter, more local production — something the pandemic proved we urgently need. When global trade stalled in 2020, companies relying on distant suppliers faced shortages and slowdowns. Now, 79% of the U.S. manufacturers reliant on Asia have either begun the reshoring process or plan to soon. This manufacturing revival isn’t just reshaping national supply chains.

It’s no longer just about how cheap something is. It’s about how well it’s made, how sustainably it’s produced and whether your team is proud to stand behind it.
