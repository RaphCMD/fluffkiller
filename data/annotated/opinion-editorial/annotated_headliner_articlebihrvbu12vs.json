      "paragraph": "Instead of choosing a bold reformer to lead the Division of Motor Vehicles, Stein picked Paul Tine — a former legislator, small business owner, and, most importantly, someone Republican lawmakers are comfortable with. Elected as a Democrat, Tine later caucused with them as an unaffiliated representative in the House.",

      "paragraph": "With the pick, this doesn’t look like a rescue mission. It looks like a handoff. Stein appears to be signaling that he doesn’t want to own the DMV problem — he’s outsourcing it to the General Assembly and State Auditor Dave Boliek, both of whom are already deeply involved in restructuring the agency.",

      "paragraph": "North Carolina’s DMV has trailed the country for decades. We didn’t get online license renewals or even debit card payments until the mid-2010s. Since COVID, the cracks have widened. Wait times are out of control, and appointments are nearly impossible to find. A looming REAL ID deadline only raises the stakes.",

      "paragraph": "To replace him, Stein’s administration floated the idea of a bold reset. In an interview, Secretary of Transportation Joey Hopkins said the job required someone who had “led large organizations” and understood “change management.” A Chick-fil-A-style operator — someone who can run complex systems and still move a line — might have fit the bill.",

      "paragraph": "In an ideal world, a governor with a clear vision would treat this like a top-tier turnaround job. He’d recruit a high-level operator from the private sector — someone with a track record of overhauling customer experience at scale — and give them the authority and resources to rebuild the agency from the ground up.",

      "paragraph": "But that’s not how this role has ever worked. The DMV commissioner has typically been a bureaucrat or political appointee, handed a mess and left to manage public frustration. It’s a thankless job. Not many top-tier executives are raising their hands.",
