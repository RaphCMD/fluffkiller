  "headline": "Caste Census: Can BJP Navigate Mandal 3.0?",
  "context": [
    "The Modi government's decision to go in for caste enumeration in the next population census is not entirely unexpected. Although it marks a major ideological shift away from the Hindutva vision of crafting a united Hindu family undivided by caste, there were enough indications that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was preparing to bite the bullet in the aftermath of its below par performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.",
    "Not only did an important National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ally - Chirag Paswan of the Lok Janshakti Party - speak out in favour of a caste headcount soon after the Modi government 3.0 assumed office, but the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) also put its stamp of approval on the proposal as far back as last September at the end of a three-day conclave in Kerala's Palakkad."

This base forms the bedrock of the BJP's rise to power and its unshakeable grip over the election system. The outcome showed some erosion across northern and western India. But it was the collapse in Uttar Pradesh that shook them. In this most critical of all BJP strongholds, the party's seat tally plunged to 31 last year from a high of 62 in 2019, with the entire benefit going to two INDIA bloc partners, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress.",

Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnav unwittingly let the cat out of the bag with a sharp attack on the Congress while announcing the decision. He devoted most of his briefing to blasting the party for opposing a caste census through its long years in government. Of course, he side-stepped his own party's history of resistance to the idea and the fact that just before the 2024 parliamentary polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had opposed it too.",

The latter have been taking pot shots at the former ever since the Lok Sabha results were announced. Strong backing from the RSS steadied Yogi's rocking boat, but tensions have not subsided. As recently as late March this year, the BJP's MLA from Loni, Nand Kishore Gurjar, publicly slammed the Yogi government and lashed out at his handpicked chief secretary, Manoj Kumar Singh.",

The late Prime Minister, VP Singh, gambled with the implementation of the Mandal report, which gave the OBCs 26% reservation in government jobs and schools. It was a cynical political move, prompted by the resignation of his Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal and the fear of the fall of his minority government. Singh calculated that Mandal would win him the support of 85% of voters comprising OBCs, Dalits and Muslims.",
