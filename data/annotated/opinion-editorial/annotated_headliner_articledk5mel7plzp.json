    "The measles virus in Texas keeps spreading like, well, measles. The latest official number, as of Tuesday, was 663 cases and 87 hospitalizations since late January. Over the border in New Mexico are another 66 cases, and Oklahoma and Kansas have more that are believed to be linked. This is the biggest single outbreak since measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000.",
    "The best time to worry about sliding childhood vaccination rates was yesterday, but today is better than tomorrow. Last week the Journal of the American Medical Association published a paper that models alternative futures for the U.S. over the next 25 years. Under current rates of immunization, the analysis suggests that it’s likely measles will eventually become endemic again, given how contagious it is."

      "paragraph": "About 92.7% of kindergartners in 2023-24, the most recent estimate, had received two doses of the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. Compared with four years earlier, that’s down 2.5 percentage points. Over the long term, the authors write, the U.S. “may be approaching the threshold of losing sufficient population immunity to reliably prevent endemic transmission of measles.”",

      "paragraph": "Modeling a scenario “with a 10% decline” in MMR vaccination, the study projects 11.1 million measles cases in the U.S. over the next two and a half decades, which averages to 444,000 ill Americans a year. To compare, in 2024 the U.S. had 285 confirmed cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Under a scenario with a 25% drop in MMR uptake, the authors estimate an average of a million cases a year.",
