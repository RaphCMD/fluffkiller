      "paragraph": "Kansas City is heartbroken by the tragic loss of Graham Hoffman.The 29-year-old firefighter and paramedic died after being stabbed by a patient during a medical transport. Shockingly, just days before Graham's death, the suspect had been released from custody despite being charged with attacking an off-duty police officer and being deemed a danger to the public. Our justice system and society unequivocally failed to protect Graham. We believe a thorough investigation must determine what went wrong and what measures can be implemented to ensure such a tragedy never happens again. We stand with Mayor Quinton Lucas and others demanding immediate action. We urge support for organizations like the crime commission and events such as Guns and Hoses, which honor fallen heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice. We have a moral obligation to Graham, his family, and his colleagues to learn from this tragedy and ensure a safer future for all public servants and the communities they serve.",
