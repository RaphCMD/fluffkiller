    "Who will leave a more permanent mark on the federal government—Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) or Donald Trump? That's the question this presidential historian kept hoping to explore during Wednesday's 100-day media marathon, but the stopwatch kept running out.",
    "Consider this: FDR built an entirely new governmental architecture during the Great Depression. Trump has spent his first 100 days wielding a wrecking ball against that architecture during relative prosperity. The question isn't who changed more during this artificial timeframe, but whose transformation will ultimately become woven into the fabric of American governance?"

      "paragraph": "We have this marker because Roosevelt's historic 100 days in 1933 produced 15 major pieces of legislation. These weren't temporary fixes. The Tennessee Valley Authority lit up rural communities across seven states—lights that still burn nearly a century later. The Civilian Conservation Corps put young men to work on projects we still benefit from today. They are permanent fixtures in American life.",

None have dared assign a foreign-born tech billionaire to oversee wholesale demolition. Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency—DOGE, invoking both Silicon Valley disruption and royal decree—systematically eliminates what FDR built. Ironically, DOGE itself represents growth—it's a new agency.",

During those first hundred days, most positions existed only on paper. Historians estimate actual personnel expansion at 25,000-50,000 employees. Substantial, but merely foundational.",

Veterans Affairs facilities lost \"critical workers\" overnight. Research institutions lost scientific talent developed over decades. Conservative estimates place workforce reduction at 60,000-80,000 positions. Trump accomplished in weeks what historically takes years.",

FDR's expansion rested on legislative authority—15 landmark bills that created institutions with democratic legitimacy. These bodies have weathered wars, recessions, and hostile administrations.

      "paragraph": "Trump's revolution balances on executive authority alone—which means tomorrow's president can undo today's with a signature. His 135-plus executive orders face over 150 legal challenges. Courts have consistently checked his executive overreach. This creates inconsistent enforcement. Many targeted programs enjoy statutory protection no presidential order can overcome.",

Trump's executive orders may dominate headlines today, but Roosevelt's legislative landmarks have outlasted depressions, wars, and generations of political opposition. The true test of presidential transformation isn't the ability to sign papers in the Oval Office—it's creating change that survives long after you've left it. FDR's legacy has already passed that test. Trump's executive orders aren't even surviving their first court challenges.",
