      "paragraph": "Twenty-two years ago, the country star Natalie Maines stood onstage at the Shepherd’s Bush Empire in London and made an offhand statement that would come to define the next decade of her career. “Just so you know, we’re on the good side with y’all,” she told the audience, nine days before the invasion of Iraq. “We do not want this war, this violence, and we’re ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas.”",

      "paragraph": "The backlash was almost instantaneous. Ms. Maines’s band, then known as The Dixie Chicks, was blacklisted from country radio. One station left trashcans outside its headquarters for fans to dispose of their records. Ms. Maines received death threats, and had to have a police escort to shows. The visceral rage at the band also filtered out to other women: Between 2000 and 2019, songs led by female vocalists played on country radio fell from 33 per cent of records to just 16 per cent.",

There was no way for a female artist to be open or even outspoken about the pressures of the industry, the absurd sexualization of stars, the abuses of power.",

Chappell Roan has been vocal about everything from her politics to the distressing ways people invade her privacy to the expectations placed on modern artists to perfectly parse hot-button issues. Sabrina Carpenter has been unapologetic about the raunchy nature of her live shows, telling fans who find her inappropriate to simply stay away. Doechii has channelled her identity and insecurities as a queer Black artist into thrilling, quirky music. Jessie Reyez has made both a song, Gatekeeper, and a short film about the producer whom she says berated her and tried to coerce her into having sex with him.",

      "paragraph": "Our history shows us that the music industry has always made impossible demands of women. During the 1990s, the activist energy of the riot-grrrl movement and unashamedly political artists such as Sinead O’Connor, Alanis Morissette and Tori Amos led to those women being sidelined in the 2000s by a new generation of young, pliable, easily sexualized stars. In 2007, when Ms. Morissette unexpectedly dropped a mournful, piano-accompanied parody cover of the Black-Eyed Peas’ My Humps, the video underscored the absurdity of what music had done to women, requiring them to twerk in rayon hot pants surrounded by fully-clothed men and never utter a word of protest.",

What was clear was that there was no way for female artists to win: If they were open about what they believed in, and how the music industry treated them, they were shunned; if they played along, they were abused.",

      "paragraph": "The treatment of women in this moment was profoundly cruel. And it seems to have made an impact on our current generation of stars, who set their own boundaries, refuse to be shamed for their sexuality, and direct their own marketing campaigns and creative output. They’re up front with their fans about what they will and won’t allow. As a result, Ms. Roan has said, people are now much more respectful of her boundaries when she’s out in public. Nor has her career suffered: Earlier this year, she won her first Grammy Award for Best New Artist, in a field of nominees that also included Doechii and Ms. Carpenter. Taking heed of what happened to the women who came before them, today’s pop icons also seem to sense all the ways in which performing for the male gaze is a trap. Instead, they celebrate their sexuality on their own terms, often in absurdist, lavishly overstated style.",
