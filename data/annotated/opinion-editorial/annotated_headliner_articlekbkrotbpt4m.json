  "headline": "Tariffs Shrink the U.S. Economy - WSJ",
  "context": [
    "The first-quarter decline in the U.S. economy reported Wednesday may not portend a recession, but it was worse than most economists expected. The main story we see throughout the data is that President Trump’s tariffs are holding growth hostage.",
    "Gross domestic product shrank 0.3% in the first estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and most of the damage came from soaring imports. Imported goods and services rose 41.3% in the quarter—goods alone by 50.9%—as businesses rushed to get ahead of Mr. Trump’s various border taxes. Imports subtracted a startling 5.03% from GDP."

      "paragraph": "This shows how tariffs distorted the data and make it hard to judge if the first quarter is a trend or an outlier. The same goes for the 21.9% spike in first-quarter private investment, which would normally be a good omen for future growth. But the 22.5% increase in equipment purchases suggests this is another case of companies front-running the tariffs. Buy now before prices rise in the components they need to stay in business.",

      "paragraph": "Private domestic investment contributed 3.6% to GDP, while rising inventories contributed 2.25%. That offset the impact of soaring imports and a modest decline in federal government spending. The latter also subtracts from GDP, but the Biden blowout in government spending had boosted growth in unsustainable fashion.",
      "reason": "The paragraph provides specific data on GDP contributions and context on government spending, relevant to the economic impact of tariffs.",
