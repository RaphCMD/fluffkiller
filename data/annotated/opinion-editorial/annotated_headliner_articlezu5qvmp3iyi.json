  "headline": "Opinion | RFK Jr. proves the fallacy of ‘doing your own research’ - The Washington Post",
  "context": [
    "Back in the early 1990s, pre-mass internet, when being a conspiracy theorist was really more of a regional gig than a national one, an Arizona radio host named Milton William Cooper propagated a loose consortium of theories via shortwave broadcast on topics including but not limited to: the Kennedy assassination, the U.S. government, Waco, AIDS, the IRS, the Illuminati — and of course, UFOs. The government was lying to you, his theories went. Aliens were in on it. JFK was killed because he was about to reveal the stuff about the government and the aliens.",
    "In 2001 Cooper shot a sheriff’s deputy who had come to arrest him after a dispute with a neighbor, and Cooper was then shot and killed. But one legacy he left with all of us was his oft-repeated instruction, “Do your own research,” which for years became a catchphrase mostly for the woo-woo set of America — the Elvis-is-alive crowd, the Fox Mulders, QAnon — until this week when Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said it in an interview with Dr. Phil."

      "paragraph": "The context was vaccines (it’s always vaccines with that guy), and the advice was directed to new parents. “Part of the responsibility of being a parent is to do your own research,” he responded to a woman who asked a question related to vaccine safety. “You research the baby stroller, you research the foods that they’re getting, and you need to research the medicines that they’re taking as well.”",
      "reason": "This paragraph provides direct commentary on RFK Jr.'s stance on vaccines and his advice to parents, which is central to the article's premise.",

      "paragraph": "Kennedy has spent recent weeks seemingly trying to sound mainstream when it comes to vaccines. “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” he wrote in a social media post in early April following measles-related deaths. But the Dr. Phil appearance was the mask slipping and the dog whistles blowing, because “do your own research” in modern America apparently only ever means “hey, maybe we should have injected ourselves with Lysol during covid.”",

      "paragraph": "It probably goes without saying, but just in case: Researching a vaccine is substantially more complicated than researching a stroller. You research strollers by typing “best strollers” into Wirecutter and buying whichever one has cupholders. You research a vaccine by getting a PhD in immunology or cellular and molecular biology, acquiring a lab in which you can conduct months or years worth of double-blind clinical trials, publishing your findings in a peer-reviewed academic journal, and then patiently navigating the government and industry regulations that are required to make sure your vaccine is safe and effective.",

      "paragraph": "“Do your own research” is an insidious phrase. It’s the brother of “just asking questions,” the cousin of “for argument’s sake.” It sounds objectively neutral. Nobody is saying you should believe their research, just your own — nobody is pushing an agenda. But it is based on an unspoken shared understanding that the official story is suspect. That research by experts is a scam. That there are things that nobody wants you to know. In 2023, University of Wisconsin-Madison and University of Michigan researchers published a study that found that when people felt positively about “doing their own research,” they were more likely to believe misinformation about the pandemic and to mistrust scientific institutions in general.",

      "paragraph": "In the real world, if parents were truly doing quality research, they would be learning and believing that so-called links between vaccines and autism have been repeatedly discredited, and that inoculating your child against deadly diseases is the best way to protect them from deadly diseases. Instead, we’re somehow having measles outbreaks in the year of our Lord 2025. You would think that the HHS secretary might pivot away from the language tics of the conspiracy theorists instead of trotting them out with Dr. Phil, but then again this is the same man who confidently declared that “autism destroys families” and that “many [autistic individuals] will never use a toilet unassisted.”",

The problem is not that the phrase is lying about the truth, it’s that the phrase is implying there is no such thing as the truth. There’s only what you can find online and what I can find online, and how you can build those tidbits into a house and I can build them into a flaming port-a-potty.",

Start down the wrong rabbit hole and you get less well-informed, more outraged and less empowered, all the while being flattered into believing you’re the one controlling your information diet.",

The history of women’s health issues being dismissed by doctors is well-documented. Because when my daughter was 2 months old I started to wonder if she had a milk allergy, and her pediatrician was dubious, but I bought the hypoallergenic formula anyway and suddenly the symptoms seemed to go away. “Do your own research” feels like a way of wresting back some control in a world that is often complex and terrifying, even if it turns out that control is an illusion.",

Maybe this is just a lament for how we got to this place, where parents are confused enough to ask whether they should accept long-standing medical guidelines that one of the top medical figureheads in the country doesn’t seem to know if he accepts, either.
