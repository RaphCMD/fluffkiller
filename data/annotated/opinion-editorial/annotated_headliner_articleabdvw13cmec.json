  "context": [
    "In March, unbeknownst to me, I apparently did not tap my trolley card correctly before hopping on. I was riding the trolley for about three stops when MTS security enforcement came on board and asked to check my card. I handed it to them without a care, but when they scanned it and saw that I hadn’t tapped, they asked me to step outside the trolley with them.",
    "After having only ridden a few stops I asked to go and tap my card and be on my way. The officer said that it was no longer allowed to validate on the spot, which was news to me. He asked for my card, ID, and then began interrogating me for the better part of half an hour. I had a friend with me, so I wasn’t too scared, but the officer treated me as if I had committed the worst crime known to man."

He even went as far as to say that I hadn’t tapped my card all day, even though I had that morning at 9 a.m., which he later verified but maintained that it wasn’t that morning.",

This policy offers no wiggle room for any riders who may accidentally mis-tap their card or even those whose fare expired a minute prior.",

Although any college student in San Diego with a semester pass, or anyone with a prepaid pass, was still expected to tap, they were not penalized. MTS claims that this new policy was implemented because they were losing up to $1 million a year and that this will ensure that riders pay every single time.",

My card gets tapped either way.",

Riders should still tap on a validator every time, every ride prior to boarding to ensure the fare is still valid. If a rider is given a citation but can prove they had a valid day or month pass at the time of the citation, they can appeal the citation with MTS.”",
