  "headline": "Opinion | Trump scrambles as tariffs hurt the economy and his approval falls - The Washington Post",
  "context": [
    "This week brought the grim news that the Trump administration’s policies had thrown the economy into reverse, turning the 2.4 percent annualized GDP growth of the last quarter of 2024 into a 0.3 percent contraction in the first quarter of 2025. It was the worst showing since the pandemic, ending nearly three years of steady expansion.",
    "“Growth has simply vanished,” Chris Rupkey, chief economist at financial research firm Fwdbonds, wrote to clients. Though some of the reversal might have been caused by a surge in imports before President Donald Trump’s tariffs took effect, “there is simply no way for policy advisers to sugarcoat this,” he wrote."
