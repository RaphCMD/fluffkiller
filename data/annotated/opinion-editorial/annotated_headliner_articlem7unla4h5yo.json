  "headline": "Opinion: Why is Alberta hiding survey results on renewable energy? | Edmonton Journal",
  "context": [
    "What is the government trying to hide from the Alberta public when it sends Postmedia a stack of 300 fully redacted pages of survey results about Alberta’s renewable energy industry? To start, responding to a legitimate freedom of information request with 300 blank pages raises serious concerns about the Alberta government’s commitment to transparency.",
    "Now, Alberta’s information and privacy commissioner is on the case."

    {
      "paragraph": "If the Alberta government thought that the public feedback about throttling back renewable energy development matched its messaging, it wouldn’t be hiding the results of the survey. Instead, we are left to speculate what Albertans had to say when asked if they believed renewable energy development and farming could go hand in hand.",
      "reason": "This paragraph directly addresses the issue of the hidden survey results and speculates on the possible public opinion, which is central to the article's premise.",

      "paragraph": "For the record, I support the conservation and protection of farmland in Alberta. Preserving our farming and ranching economies in Alberta is a critical part of our province’s responsibility to present and future generations.",
      "reason": "This paragraph is a personal opinion on farmland conservation, which is not directly related to the hidden survey results.",
      "label": 0
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "However, the real threat from energy development on farmland isn’t solar farms or wind turbines, but the oil and gas industry. There are hundreds of thousands of oil and gas wells across Alberta’s agricultural landscapes, and while some of these are owned and operated by responsible players, many are not.",
      "reason": "This paragraph provides context on energy development threats but does not directly relate to the hidden survey results.",
      "label": 0
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "In Alberta, there are more than 250,000 wells that have been abandoned or orphaned, and the legally responsible owners of these assets — oil and gas companies — have simply walked away from their obligation to clean up after themselves.",
      "reason": "This paragraph discusses abandoned wells, which is not directly related to the hidden survey results on renewable energy.",

      "paragraph": "The Alberta government claims that because the survey results constitute “advice to the government,” it is within its right to withhold the responses. However, the purpose of this clause in the Freedom of Information and Privacy (FOIP) Act isn’t to withhold public sentiment on a topic, but instead to allow senior government officials to provide advice without the glare of scrutiny. Individual public survey responses are no more “advice” to cabinet ministers than are call-in show respondents providing their opinion on the news of the day.",
      "reason": "This paragraph provides essential context and analysis regarding the government's justification for withholding survey results.",

    {
      "paragraph": "There has been a lot of speculation about the Alberta government’s motivation for the renewable energy moratorium and subsequent punitive measures that restrict where you can build wind and solar power. Interestingly, it didn’t place a moratorium on new oil and gas wells at the same time.",
      "reason": "This paragraph offers relevant context about the government's actions related to renewable energy and fossil fuels.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "A leading theory about why this is the case is based on the influence the natural gas industry has over the government, and the industry’s concerns over unwanted competition from wind and solar. Another is the possibility of influential and politically connected land owners in wind and solar energy-rich southern Alberta raising objections to renewables.",
      "reason": "This paragraph provides theories and context about potential motivations behind the government's actions.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Whatever the motivation for the renewables pause and the subsequent adoption of regressive rules, the Alberta government doesn’t want us to know how Albertans really feel about future renewable energy development. Some of those opinions may reflect knowledge of how renewables and farming happily co-exist in other places around the world where agrivoltaics — combining solar, wind and livestock grazing — has become synonymous with good farming and energy development practices.",
      "reason": "This paragraph discusses potential reasons for the government's secrecy and provides context on renewable energy practices.",
      "label": 1
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Maybe the government doesn’t want Albertans to know that while people here support the petroleum sector, we also embrace, albeit cautiously — we are Albertans, after all — renewable energy as part of our future economic well-being.",
      "reason": "This paragraph speculates on the government's motives and public opinion on renewable energy.",

    {
      "paragraph": "Transparency is the foundation of any democratic government. Petrostates try to hide, and ultimately obscure the truth when it conflicts with the message they have decided they want people to hear. In the case of Alberta, the preferred message is that oil and gas, not clean, inexpensive renewable energy, will provide Alberta with continued prosperity. The truth about the future of both Alberta’s family farms and our renewable energy markets is much too important to be hidden from the public.",
      "reason": "This paragraph critiques the government's transparency and discusses the implications for Alberta's energy future.",
