      "paragraph": "Canada has one of the most uncompetitive banking systems in the industrialized world. The sector’s share of revenue relative to GDP far outstrips that of the United States, Australia, Britain and other European countries. Canada’s banks charge some of the highest fees for service in the world.",

    {
      "paragraph": "Conflating commercial interest with the public interest, Mr. Ferreira argued: “An oligopoly is actually a good thing for our country” supposedly because in times of difficulty the banks can quickly gather with the stabilizing authorities to quell the crisis. Contrary to Mr. Ferreira’s view, concentration and oligopoly at the expense of affordability are not necessary to deliver stability.",

      "paragraph": "The ghost of U.S. President Donald Trump haunts every corridor of Canada’s politics, and the economic damage and blow to investor confidence from his assault on our country is an existential challenge. We need to review every dimension of our economic model to withstand this assault, and our financial sector is no exception. Yet the spin from the bank CEOs in the face of this challenge shows it will take a political backbone of steel to deliver change.",

      "paragraph": "We can make our banking industry more competitive and consumer-friendly by leveraging the power of financial technology. Progress to date has been obstructed by the lack of political support for open banking, which is well advanced elsewhere. Open banking, or the ability to access many competitively priced financial service providers beyond the banking system safely and securely, has been up and running in Britain since 2018.",

      "paragraph": "Other industrialized countries balance stability in their banking system with competition. Sadly, Canada struggles to embrace competition because it requires the taking of calculated risk. Policy makers have failed to make competition in banking a priority and continue to provide a taxpayer-supported, too-big-to-fail, stability subsidy.",
