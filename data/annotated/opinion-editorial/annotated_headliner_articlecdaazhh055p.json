  "headline": "Trump’s Solid First Judicial Nominee - WSJ",
  "context": [
    "There’s been chatter in MAGA circles that President Trump’s second-term judicial nominees should be ideologues willing to deliver political results, not Federalist Society types who follow the law. Mr. Trump has ignored this unproductive noise in making his first pick. Late Thursday he said he’d chosen Whitney Hermandorfer for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.",
    "Ms. Hermandorfer is the director of strategic litigation for Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, who has a case at the Supreme Court this term (U.S. v. Skrmetti) defending his state’s ban on giving gender-transition hormones to minors. Mr. Skrmetti praised the nomination on Friday, saying Ms. Hermandorfer is “an absolute rock star,” “a lawyer’s lawyer,” and “perhaps the single most credentialed lawyer in America, having clerked for a full third of the justices on the Supreme Court.”"
