    "Once again, I find myself in sun-drenched Morocco, a North African country steeped in history and culture. I’ve come to bask in the warmth, balancing my days between writing and wandering – one of the joys of being able to work from anywhere.",
    "At the moment, I am perched on the roof terrace of a co-living hostel, sipping mint tea. Below, the cheerful voices of Berber children playing football echo through narrow streets, while the adhan, the Islamic call to prayer, floats in the air. In the distance, the sea glitters in the sunshine like so many diamonds."
