    "More importantly, Trump’s constant fiddling with the tariff dials and his claims that they are merely a short-term negotiating tactic undermine any hope of building new factories in America. One of the most important requirements for business investment is policy certainty. No entrepreneur will undertake an expensive, five-year project to build a new factory that is needed to last 50 years if the underlying trade economics are changing monthly or even weekly. Tariff, tax and regulatory policies may be helpful or hurtful, but they at least must be predictable.",

      "paragraph": "Even more contradictory is Trump’s promises that tariffs can build a trade wall around America while also raising trillions of dollars in tax revenues to replace the income tax. A tariff cannot raise revenues from imports if those goods are no longer being imported. Tariffs can either lock out imports or collect revenues from them, but they cannot do both.",

      "paragraph": "Conservatives love to cite (an exaggerated version of) the Laffer Curve to claim that hiking income tax rates will collapse the tax base and thus reduce tax revenues. Yet in international trade — where the Laffer Curve is actually more relevant — the same conservatives often deny that steeply hiking tariffs will bring any economic or consumer behavioral responses to shrink the tariff base and pull back revenues.",

      "paragraph": "In reality, the U.S. imports $3.2 trillion of goods that can theoretically be subject to tariffs. But even at low tariff rates, they reduce demand for imports; it is mathematically impossible for tariffs to replace $2.6 trillion of annual income taxes because no tariff rate could raise that much money after accounting for the corresponding reduction in import demand. Yes, an average tariff rate of 20 percent could theoretically raise $640 billion in tariff revenue. However, the decline in import demand and the slowdown in broader economic activity would drastically reduce those revenues, while more bailouts of export-hammered industries like agriculture would likely consume most remaining revenues. Any deficit reduction would be marginal and not worth the economic chaos.",

      "paragraph": "In his recent address to Congress, Trump promised that “In the near future, I want to do what has not been done in 24 years: balance the federal budget.

Yet Trump has already promised no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, defense and veterans’ benefits, and he cannot directly reduce interest payments. That’s 66 percent of the budget taken off the table (or 75 percent if we include Medicaid, which Trump occasionally promises to spare from the budget ax).",

This includes his promised “no tax on tips,” ending taxes on overtime and Social Security payments and reducing corporate taxes. He also endorsed significant new spending for defense and border security.

      "paragraph": "Nor does the president’s “Department of Government Efficiency” cut through this nonsense or improve this fiscal calculus. Despite Elon Musk’s promises to immediately save $2 trillion (later scaled down to $1 trillion and now to $150 billion), DOGE is limited by the aforementioned presidential pledges not to touch the two-thirds of federal spending that is actually driving spending upward. Moreover, DOGE is forbidden by the U.S. Constitution, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and repeated Supreme Court jurisprudence from unilaterally canceling spending that was approved by Congress and signed into law. DOGE can cancel contracts, reduce payment errors and move money around, but its more sweeping attempts to eliminate federal agencies and programs will likely be reversed by the courts unless Congress passes legislation blessing such moves.",

The rest of the claimed savings are either not backed up with specific data or based on mathematical errors, triple-counting the same savings and theoretical “savings” of funds that were never going to be spent. Ultimately, DOGE is government spending-cut theater that targets MAGA cultural totems such as DEI contracts, media subscriptions, federal employees and foreign aid that collectively save little money. Which is why total federal spending this year currently exceeds the level of spending during the same period last year.",

      "paragraph": "In fact, DOGE is likely to ultimately expand budget deficits. Drastic layoffs of IRS tax enforcement employees are expected to encourage tax evasion and cost the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. Gutting the Department of Education risks laying off the employees who collect student loan repayments. Even many of the laid off federal employees are currently collecting salaries and benefits while courts weigh the legality of their job cuts. These losses may ultimately exceed DOGE’s modest budget savings and leave it as a deficit expander.",

It’s like a debt-ridden family buying a $100,000 sports car one year and then asserting that buying another next year is not costly because their annual spending level is not rising.
