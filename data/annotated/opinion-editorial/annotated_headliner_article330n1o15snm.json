      "paragraph": "Stanford brags that “it’s pretty ‘sweet’ to be connected with Stanford” thanks to the perks its professors and staff receive. Perhaps the sweetest perks Stanford and other elite universities provide are the multimillion-dollar tax-free housing and tuition stipends they lavish on faculty, staff and their children. They’re tax giveaways most Americans don’t get to enjoy, though they effectively cover the cost. It’s long past time to close these tax loopholes.",

      "paragraph": "The exact benefits universities provide to staff and their children vary but are consistently extravagant. Schools such as Columbia pay a significant portion of K-12 private school tuition for professors and senior administrators, often covering about 50% of tuition costs—which can run upward of $65,000 a year at New York’s top private schools. Some institutions, such as the University of Chicago, require that employees’ children attend the university’s lab school for some benefits. But Chicago still subsidizes tuition by at least 50%. It adds up. Tuition for grades 9-12 at Chicago’s lab school is $46,824, and in recent years Chicago paid that school approximately $28 million in tuition for faculty and staff.",
