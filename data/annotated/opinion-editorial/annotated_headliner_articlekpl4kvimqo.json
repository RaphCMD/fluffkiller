In manufacturing-heavy Southwestern Ontario, Conservatives won over some last-minute New Democrat switchers to sweep much of the region. All those visuals of Mr. Poilievre in a hard hat paid off.",

In part that means talking more about the centrality of family in society. But it also means addressing the affordability concerns of moms by some combination of expanding child benefits and/or bringing in a Conservative child-care plan. And how about expanding the federal school food program to help moms with school-aged kids? Mr. Poilievre could use a jujitsu move or two to show he’s changed his mind on something since he was a teenager. Mr. Harper closed the gender gap in 2011 with these kinds of appeals to mothers – and snagged some grandmothers too!",

To do so, he needs to not just talk housing and affordability, but bring a much more credible offering on climate change. How about another jujitsu move: an industrial carbon tax has been the centrepiece of climate policy in Alberta, from Ed Stelmach to Danielle Smith. Just as it is in every other province. There is nothing Mr. Poilievre can do to end these provincial regimes, so why not just commit to “making polluters pay” and keep the federal industrial backstop?",
