One survey, on which leader can better take on Mr. Trump, showed Mr. Carney with a nearly 40-percentage-point lead over the Conservatives’ Pierre Poilievre.

Exports carry three times the weight in Canada’s economy then they do in the U.S. economy and three-quarters of all Canadian exports go to American markets. Or at least they did.",

Ironically in this case, the Canadian industry is as much the victim of trade as is the U.S. industry. If NAFTA was the worst trade deal ever negotiated for American autoworkers, as Mr. Trump frequently claims, it was an even worse deal for Canadian auto workers.

Unlike America’s lead negotiator Robert Lighthizer, whose primary objective was to safeguard jobs, Canada’s chief negotiator, then-foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland, had a very different objective. She championed the interests of shareholders in Canadian auto parts manufacturers such as Magna over the interests of their rapidly shrinking Canadian work force, all under the guise of claiming solidarity with Mexico. And while Ms. Freeland publicly criticized anti-union right-to-work legislation in a number of U.S. states, she had nothing to say about Mexico’s infamous “ghost” unions that Canadian auto parts manufacturers, among others in the industry, routinely use to negotiate wage settlements, typically one-eighth of the wage rates negotiated by real unions for autoworkers back in Canada and in the United States.",

Faced with what then-president Joe Biden called crippling sanctions, a claim parroted by Justin Trudeau and other Western leaders, Russia’s energy sector has gone on to post record export earnings courtesy of the welcoming arms of China’s and India’s vast energy markets.
