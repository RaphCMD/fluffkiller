    "A common refrain among American economists is that the U.S. shouldn’t be overly concerned with its declining share of global manufacturing. They point out that manufacturing has accounted for a shrinking portion of U.S. employment over the years and that automation rather than trade is responsible for most of the dip in employment."

      "paragraph": "This argument is built on an important misunderstanding—one that conflates two different sources of manufacturing job losses. When employment in manufacturing declines because of rising productivity, the change should be welcomed, not feared. It means that fewer workers are needed to produce more output. This isn’t deindustrialization; it is smarter, more-efficient production. As long as wages rise with overall productivity, it creates as many good jobs as it destroys.",
      "reason": "The paragraph provides a counterargument to the common economic perspective, offering a nuanced view on manufacturing job losses and productivity.",
