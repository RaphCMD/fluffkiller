    "Around the world, and especially within the shadowed corridors of the Vatican, human forces will try to shape the outcome of the papal election. That is to be expected. Conclaves, for all their ritual and spiritual mystique, are still human affairs. Cardinals read the mood of the church. They form alliances. Some whisper. Some maneuver. Some conspire. Some retreat to pray."
