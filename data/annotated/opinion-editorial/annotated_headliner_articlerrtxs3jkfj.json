      "paragraph": "When Donald Trump threatened to annex Canada, I wondered why his remarks appeared to sting Canadians’ psyche so deeply. It is not as if the Trump administration has not uttered a barrage of insults at other countries and peoples.",

      "paragraph": "But this threat seemed to expose a long-standing insecurity – so much so that even people in Quebec and Alberta, who have shown separatist sentiments, were offended.",

      "paragraph": "In her 1972 book Survival, Margaret Atwood examined patterns in Canadian literature in search of a uniquely Canadian expression of identity, and revealed our preoccupation with “survival.” Now, amid uncertainty about our existence, survival is our preoccupation again.",

    {
      "paragraph": "It was the overarching theme of the recent federal election debates. Such topics as affordable groceries and homes for young people, access to livelihoods with adequate income for all, cultural self-determination and sovereignty all reiterated our fixation with this core facet of our identity.",

    {
      "paragraph": "It has been there from the start. Canada, from its inception, has been treated as a hinterland for the extraction of renewable and non-renewable resources: first, as a supply of fish, forest products and fur to Britain, and then turning south in the 20th century, providing the U.S. oil and gas, hydroelectric power, strategic minerals and cheap educated labour, among other things. Even our finest artists and hockey players are exported south (as a professor at Cornell University in New York State, I am also culpable). Ours is a policy of beggar-thyself.",

      "paragraph": "Yet, free and fair trade is core to human survival. Different people have been trading with each other not only to live, but to live well. Trade is not only about the swapping of goods and services, after all: It facilitates the peaceful exchange of ideas and know-how. It is the nutrient that maintains biological sustenance and the cultural health of pluralist societies.",

      "paragraph": "Long before Europeans settled in North America, the diverse Indigenous peoples established trade corridors from this land’s Arctic tip to its southern point, to exchange knowledge, food and manufactured materials. Similarly, centuries before the growth of a European common market, societies and cultures in Central Asia had established overland silk roads and sea-based silk routes, overcoming conflict to achieve peaceful trade.",

    {
      "paragraph": "But Canada’s trade has historically indentured its peoples, creating among them constant anxiety around survival. So at some point we must realize that Canada’s sense of victimhood is of our own making – and that we’ve had agency all along.",

      "paragraph": "George Grant’s 1965 treatise Lament for A Nation is a frustrated call to action by a conservative moral philosopher who expressed love for his country by mourning its apparent loss of sovereignty. U.S. interference in Canada’s domestic affairs has continued apace since, including pressure to abandon the Canadian-made Avro Arrow, the unlawful kidnapping and torture of innocent Canadian Maher Arar, and now, Mr. Trump’s annexation threats.",

    {
      "paragraph": "But instead of directing our legitimate anger at the oppressor, we tend to direct it at each other. Our political leaders have easily divided us; discussions of pursuing economic opportunities too often descend into self-centred parochialism at the expense of the common good of our diverse peoples. The Trump administration has forced Canadians to recognize our victimhood; hopefully, Canadians also recognize the complicity of our political leaders in its continuation. We have, for example, greater trade barriers between our provinces than with our southern neighbour.",

      "paragraph": "It’s a fact: Mr. Trump and his ilk are not going away in four years. The storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, shows us that they will resort to violence to hold onto power, and they have made a spectacle of their legal system, which is stacked with individuals steeped in moral turpitude and dogmatic fanaticism. Universities are under threat and military commanders are being replaced. They are only gaining strength.",

      "paragraph": "So let us resist victimhood, starting with courage – because bullies cannot understand it. Let’s act by choosing leaders committed to our common good – which not only includes protecting the people, but also our land and seas for future generations. Let’s strengthen internal trade – which should naturally lead to external diversification extending well beyond Europe. And as international students seek safer places to study, our institutions of learning should embrace them, to build different ways of knowing and doing based on mutual respect and dignity of the person.",
