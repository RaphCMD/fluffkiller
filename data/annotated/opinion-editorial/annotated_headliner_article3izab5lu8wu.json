  "context": [
    "In recent years, the Chicago Tribune's transportation coverage has been very solid, thanks to reporter Sarah Freishtat, who left the paper in March. But when the paper's editorial board opines about walk/bike/transit and traffic safety issues, skepticism is warranted. Here are few recent examples of their dubious, windshield-POV claims that Streetsblog had to debunk, with links to our rebuttals.",
