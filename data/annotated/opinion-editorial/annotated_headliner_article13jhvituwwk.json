Against this massed onslaught of anti-liberal nationalists, we need a determined fightback of liberal internationalists. Canada’s election this week can contribute a strong mounted brigade. Canada’s extraordinary turnaround election victory for the Liberals under Mark Carney shows what’s possible, and Australia may follow in its federal election next weekend.",

      "paragraph": "A core insight of liberalism is that, if people are to live together well in conditions of freedom, power always needs to be dispersed, cross-examined and controlled. Faced with the raw, bullying assertion of might, whether from Washington, Moscow or Beijing, we now have to create countervailing concentrations of power. In the long history of liberalism, a free press, the law, labour unions, a business community kept separate from political power, NGOs, truth-seeking institutions such as universities, civil resistance, multilateral organizations and international alliances have all served, alongside multiparty politics and regular free and fair elections, to constrain the men who would be kings.",

      "paragraph": "In rallying everyone who believes in equal individual liberty to this fight, we liberals have a problem of our own making. Policies associated in many people’s minds with liberalism over the last 40 years have themselves fed the reservoirs of popular discontent from which nationalist populists continue to draw support. Neoliberalism, hypercharged through a globalized financialized capitalism, has led to levels of inequality not seen for a hundred years. An identity politics intended to remedy the historic disadvantages of selected minorities has left many other members of our societies – especially white, male, working- and middle-class – feeling themselves culturally as well as economically neglected. Both these approaches reneged on liberalism’s central promise, lucidly summarized by the philosopher Ronald Dworkin as “equal respect and concern“ for all.",

      "paragraph": "Neoliberalism has also turned the world’s most powerful democracy into something very close to oligarchy. The separation of private wealth and public power, a precious and fragile innovation of modern liberal democracy, has been reversed. Insatiable plutocrats such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg are now supporters of Donald Trump’s political power, while he promotes his own and his rich pals’ economic interests. With the help of the media and platforms these plutocrats control, Mr. Trump persuades many ordinary Americans that their suffering is entirely due to foreigners (immigrants, China), while in fact it’s much more the fault of people like Mr. Musk, Mr. Bezos and Mr. Zuckerberg.",

Electoral authoritarian states like Turkey and Hungary also have lots of would-be-free citizens. The world’s largest example of applied liberal internationalism, the 27-country European Union, will be crucial to the fightback.

      "paragraph": "We need to do many things at once. Promoting free trade against Trumpian beggar-thy-neighbour protectionism is an obvious starting point. It’s also easier said than done, since mutually beneficial trading arrangements take time to craft. Yet there are some accessible immediate wins. A trade agreement between the EU and the MERCOSUR group of Latin American states only awaits ratification by all relevant parties. Britain and the EU should be more ambitious at their coming summit on May 19. The EU doesn’t need anyone else’s involvement for it to create a single digital space and unified capital markets, nor to build up European defence industries, which would also serve as a neo-Keynesian economic stimulus.",

Imagine that one day your iPhone and iPad stopped working, along with your cloud provider, as well as Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and X. What would be left? The Chinese app TikTok! “And Bluesky,” you may add, referencing the liberal social platform of choice – but that too is American. This is not only about infrastructure.

It will be transformed both by us learning from our own mistakes, so as to build back better, and by the revolutionary impact of Mr. Trump.

Canada, for example, which once seemed – and I mean this in the nicest possible way – somewhat peripheral to world affairs, comfortably tucked up there between a friendly America and a frozen Arctic, now suddenly looks like a frontline state. One of the world’s most liberal countries is, beside Ukraine, one of the most directly threatened by Mr. Trump’s anti-liberal assault. And the thawing Arctic is a major new theatre of international competition. Fortunately, it looks as if Canada is going to have a government that is not just Liberal in name but also combatively liberal in nature.",
