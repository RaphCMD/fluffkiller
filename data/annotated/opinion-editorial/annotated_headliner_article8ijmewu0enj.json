      "paragraph": "You may not have noticed it amid the headlines over President Donald Trump’s assault on migrants and elite universities and his demotion of his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, but the president recently came out in favor of some core policy priorities of the Democratic Party: job training programs, combating climate change and bringing economic growth to low-income areas.",

This week, we were given the perfect bipartisan vehicle to do so: Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, and Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, introduced the SHIPS for America Act on April 30, proposing the funding to make the president’s executive order successful. Congressional Democrats should make it a critical legislative priority and to pass this bill and bring American shipbuilding back from the brink of extinction.",

      "paragraph": "America led the world in shipbuilding as recently as the 1980s, but the industry is now a shell of its former self. China dominates the market and we produce just 0.1% of the world’s ships by weight. A host of factors have led to this sorry state of affairs. The federal government stopped funding the Construction Differential Subsidy, which reimbursed U.S. shipbuilders for up to half the cost difference between constructing ships in the U.S. and abroad. Over the years, all three branches of government, plus states and local counties, have made domestic ship production harder by adding numerous regulations and community and environmental reviews that made it difficult to expand and modernize shipyards. Our high schools, community colleges, technical schools and universities have failed to produce the workforce necessary for a world-class shipbuilding industry.",

      "paragraph": "Trump is a longtime skeptic of climate change science, but a side benefit of his shipbuilding initiative is that it could prevent millions of tons of carbon emissions. That’s because America is home to some of the world’s best inland waterways, and inland barges used to ship domestic goods produce just half the carbon emissions that trains do, and just a ninth of the emissions from trucks. Medium and heavy-duty trucks in the U.S. emit more than 410 million tons of carbon a year; even partially replacing them with barges could have a significant impact.",

But so far, he’s gotten kudos only from his right flank, and much of that has been for actions that trample checks and balances and democratic cornerstones.
