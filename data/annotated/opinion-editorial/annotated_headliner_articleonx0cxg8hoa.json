  "context": [
    "SEBI Warning Against Trading Platform: India’s markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), has cautioned investors against dealing with ‘opinion trading platforms,’ a new segment in the country’s burgeoning online real money gaming and betting market, which allows users to win money by placing bets on the likelihood of a real-life event taking place.",
    "So far, such platforms – which are regulated in countries like the United States – largely went under the regulatory radar in India, but government agencies now appear to be turning their attention towards the sector. And that’s for good reason: the industry has so far raised more than Rs 4,200 crore in funding from over 35 investors which include Sequoia Capital (PeakXV), Elevation Capital, Accel Partners, Soma Capital and Y Combinator."
