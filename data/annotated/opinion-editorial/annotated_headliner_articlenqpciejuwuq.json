  "headline": "Opinion: After the election, we need a Canada that works for Alberta | Edmonton Journal",
  "context": [
    "Canada has elected its new government and prime minister. Now, the challenges facing Canada remain, and require urgent action. Canada, but particularly the West, is watching closely how this government will define its approach. I believe they have weeks, if not days, to show action that will unite the country.",
    "Albertans are concerned because this next chapter cannot be like the last decade. We have experienced a decade of economic stagnation. Affordability has plummeted. Housing is too scarce and increasingly out of reach for many. Canada’s immigration system, once hailed as a global model, is not working for the majority of immigrants, Canadians, or Canadian companies."

Albertans put forward solutions, often backed by research, collaboration, and a genuine will to help. We pay more than our share. We build, produce, and power a disproportionate portion of Canada’s economy. And yet, we too often receive less in return: less respect, less support, and less policy that is supportive of our industries and sectors — in fact, it often feels downright discriminatory against our success.",

It is also essential that Canada become far more pragmatic, and less ideological, about environmental policy. Canadians want clean air, clean water, and a healthy planet. But today, we have a patchwork of unworkable policies, like emissions caps, that don’t deliver real-world results. They delay investment. They stifle innovation.
