      "paragraph": "But enough about the Conservative Party. Is the situation as dire for the country as a whole? To listen to some of the after-election analysis, you would think we had just weeks to live. Mark Carney’s Liberals may have won the election, runs this line of thinking, but now must attempt to bind the wounds of a bitterly divided country, polarized along every conceivable line.",

      "paragraph": "Here’s pollster Darrell Bricker, writing for The Hub: “We are fractured by region, generation, class, and gender. Cities went Liberal. Rural ridings went Conservative. Older voters stuck with the status quo. Younger voters drifted right. Women leaned Carney. Men leaned away.”",

      "paragraph": "Of course, poke through the entrails of any election and you will find similar divides. It is the nature of politics that partisan preferences are not distributed evenly through the population, but lumpily, depending on age, gender, class, region, etc.",

      "paragraph": "Still, it’s easy to look at the topline results of the election and conclude the country is in a particularly divided state. The election was one of the closest on record, both in terms of the popular vote (just 2.4 percentage points separated the Liberals and Conservatives) and seats. Liberal support remains narrowly based: just three cities – Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver – accounted for more than half their seats.",

      "paragraph": "Even before the votes were counted, voices were being raised warning that a fourth straight Liberal victory would lead to a surge in support for separatism in the West, or at least Alberta – sentiments the Premier of Alberta appeared eager to amplify immediately after the election by lowering the threshold for citizen-initiated referendums. You may guess on what subject.",

    {
      "paragraph": "It is surely worth noting, if we are talking about division and polarization, that at a time of national crisis, with the country’s very existence under threat from its near neighbour, the people of Canada turned, in historic numbers, not to the sorts of extremist parties that have arisen lately in other countries, but to the two most moderate, mainstream parties.",

      "paragraph": "The Liberals and the Conservatives each took over 40 per cent of the vote. The last time that happened was 1930. (It had been 25 years since even one of them had managed it.) The two, moreover, offered not starkly different prescriptions for the country, but converged on the centre, offering broadly similar policies on all the major issues: taxes, housing, immigration, pipelines, defence and Donald Trump.",

    {
      "paragraph": "That’s disappointing from a democratic choice standpoint – the election was notably deficient on new ideas or serious discussion about the difficult choices the country is facing, and was even before Mr. Trump – but if the contention is that the middle ground of Canadian politics has given way (an argument that could have been fairly made a couple of years ago) it was hard to find evidence of it in this election. We are divided, not polarized.",

      "paragraph": "Most of the demographic divisions mentioned are manageable. Indeed, you could argue they are evidence of the system at work. Liberals have forgotten how to speak to young men: the results are, or should be, a wakeup call to them. Conservatives, likewise, are clearly alienating young women. That, too, is something they can work on, if they choose to. At any rate, neither party can pretend to be unaware of its deficiencies.",

      "paragraph": "The exception is region, which in this fractious, barely federated country is obviously rife with toxic potential. But even here, the results are, viewed in historical context, undismaying, even … heartening. By context, I mean: we do not have national parties in this country. We have regional parties – the Liberals in eastern Canada, the Conservatives in the West – masquerading as national parties. The last time the Liberals carried the West was in 1949. The Conservatives have won a majority of the seats in Quebec just three times since 1887.",

They have not posted numbers like this in those provinces since 1968. The Tories, for their part, took 24 per cent of the vote in Quebec – one of their best results in decades, exceeded only by the Mulroney sweeps. I don’t care what party you support, from a national unity standpoint these are comparatively good results – as is the sharp decline of the Bloc, though it was not nearly sharp enough.",

      "paragraph": "Why, then, is it still possible to speak of the Liberals having been largely “shut out” of Alberta and Saskatchewan, or the Conservatives of Quebec? Because of our electoral system: yes, our old friend First Past the Post. In return for winning nearly 30 per cent of the vote in Alberta the Liberals were rewarded with exactly two of the province’s 37 seats. In Saskatchewan they won just one.",

      "paragraph": "In Quebec, similarly, the Conservatives, with a quarter of the popular vote, took just 11 seats out of a total of 78. It’s not as bonkers as in some past elections – in 1980 the Liberals won just two seats west of Ontario, the Conservatives just one seat in Quebec – but it’s clearly a comically distorted picture of the country, one that plays into the hands of those seeking to mine our divisions for political advantage.",

      "paragraph": "Worse, these distortions, having exaggerated our differences, help to deepen them. There’s no doubt the Liberals have, over the years, been at best deaf to Alberta’s concerns, sometimes even hostile.

      "paragraph": "A Liberal might complain that they can’t win seats there, thanks to first past the post. But it’s at least as true to say that they don’t need to – again, thanks to first past the post. The same systemic bias in favour of parties that can “bunch” their votes geographically that works to their disadvantage in Alberta and Saskatchewan has tended to work in their favour in Ontario and Quebec.",

      "paragraph": "It’s the same with Conservative voters in metropolitan centres, or Liberal voters in rural Canada: they exist, in significant numbers, but because they do not tend to be the most numerous group in any particular riding, they might as well not. Which means the parties do not bother to try appealing to them, which just confirms the trend. Liberals more and more confine themselves to representing the interests and outlook of large urban centres, Conservatives more and more to small towns and rural Canada. They fight it out in the suburbs.",

      "paragraph": "First past the post has many other sins to its name: its habit of creating phoney “majority” governments, on the basis of 40 per cent or less of the vote (though even this is breaking down: this was the sixth election in the last eight to result in a hung Parliament); the strategic-voting dilemma in which it places too many voters, who are told they cannot vote for the party they prefer but must vote for a party they dislike, to prevent a party they detest from getting in; its tendency to leave many voters – a majority, in most elections – unrepresented, and so on.",

Imagine, therefore, a system in which every party had to win seats in every part of the country, no longer able to rely on racking up huge majorities in one part or another. Imagine a system of truly national parties, and truly national politics, where parties had to take into account the needs of the whole country, not just one part of it.",

      "paragraph": "That’s of particular concern at this historic moment. My unity concerns are not so much in the short term – I don’t think a referendum in Alberta would find many takers, just because the Liberals were elected – but over the longer haul. That’s precisely because of those difficult choices I mentioned were facing us. Those will inevitably involve costs, to someone, and as likely as not someone will be counting up those costs in regional terms.",

      "paragraph": "It will be crucial, in such circumstances, that there be some means of gathering consensus, of providing assurance that the costs have been fairly allocated, of persuading people to accept choices that they might not have preferred. If only there were some institution, I’m thinking an assembly of some kind, to which all parts of the country elected representatives, and which fairly represented the divisions of opinion, not only in the country as a whole, but in each part of it, and which could serve as that kind of mediating and legitimating force; a body that, because of its widely acknowledged democratic legitimacy, would have real power to call the government to account, and to prevent any regionally concentrated party from imposing the desires of that region on the rest.",
