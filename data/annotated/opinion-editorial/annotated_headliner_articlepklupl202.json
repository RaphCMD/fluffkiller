    "Canada, you may have heard, is a completely different country just to the north of America and overwhelmingly has no interest in becoming our 51st state, despite President Donald Trump's odd fixation on annexing our ally.",
    "Canadians don't vote directly for a prime minister. But they did, in the April 28 national election, vote very specifically against Trump. The election's results guaranteed that a Canadian prime minister who calls Trump a threat to his country will remain in office to stand up to him."
