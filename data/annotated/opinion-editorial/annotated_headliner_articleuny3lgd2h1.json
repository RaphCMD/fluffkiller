    "The recent whirlwind of developments in the United States including the issue of tariffs and the threats to our sovereignty, has challenged our Canadian identity and indeed the very future of Canada itself. Never has the question “what it means to be a Canadian?” been more top of mind.",
    "If you are in need of a boost of national pride or a reminder of what being a Canadian really means, just ask a “liberated” Dutch person. Or, any Dutch person who immigrated to Canada for that matter. The response may surprise you."

      "paragraph": "Eighty years ago this May, the Canadian Army liberated the Netherlands from the brutal German occupation, helping bring the Second World War to an end. For five long years, the Dutch endured a dark and seemingly hopeless period. The German Army appeared unbeatable, and their brutality knew no limits. Any form of resistance meant instant execution or imprisonment. Infiltrators were everywhere, and no one could be trusted. Intense fear hung in the air, and as the years passed, food and supplies grew ever scarce. Thousands had already died, and thousands more were on the verge of starvation during the winter of 1945, which was reported to be one of the coldest in years.",

Such were the questions immediately asked by the astonished and oppressed Dutch people.",

In the course of several months, over 7,600 soldiers died as the Canadian Army moved through the flat, unprotected Dutch countryside, village by village, town by town, region by region. But advance they did, and the Dutch people took notice — not only because of their courage and fighting skills, but because of traits before unseen — kindness, generosity and a spirit of humility.",
