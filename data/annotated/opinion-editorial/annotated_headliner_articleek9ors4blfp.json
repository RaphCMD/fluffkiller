    "The guy who’s been cutting funding and killing vital programs at the University of Alabama strolled on campus Thursday evening, and was welcomed with open arms and cheers.",
    "It was the perfect microcosm of Alabama – a state where voters continue to fight tooth and nail for people and policies that directly harm them – as Donald Trump delivered what was, I suppose, although I’m not quite certain, a commencement speech to all of the white graduates and some other white people (maybe there was a non-white person in attendance somewhere) at a university where his policies have been incredibly harmful."
